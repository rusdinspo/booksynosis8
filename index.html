<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Hermeneutics as Apprenticeship: How the Bible Shapes Our Interpretive Habits and Practices</h2><p><b>A Fresh Approach to the Art of Biblical Interpretation<br></b><br>This book offers a fresh approach to the art of biblical interpretation, focusing on the ways Scripture itself forms its readers as wise and faithful interpreters. David Starling shows that apprenticing ourselves to the interpretive practices of the biblical writers and engaging closely with texts from all parts of the Bible help us to develop the habits and practices required to be good readers of Scripture. After introducing the principles, Starling works through the canon, providing inductive case studies in interpretive method and drawing out implications for contemporary readers. Offering a fresh contribution to hermeneutical discussions, this book will be an ideal supplement to traditional hermeneutics textbooks for seminarians. It includes a foreword by Peter O'Brien.</p><p>"<i>Hermeneutics as Apprenticeship</i> is a refreshing and important call to think of biblical interpretation not in terms of mastering the text but of learning the craft of interpretation from the biblical authors themselves. Such apprenticeship is ultimately less methodological mastery than spiritual formation. Starling focuses on the way the biblical authors themselves received earlier texts and composed Scripture by means of inner-biblical interpretation. In an age of pervasive interpretive pluralism, where no single interpretive practice stands out as authoritative, Starling's case for contemporary interpreters to become apprentices to the biblical authors who know how to read the Bible, and themselves, in the light of Christ is a suggestion as timely as it is welcome."<br>--<b>Kevin J. Vanhoozer</b>, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School<br><br>"What is theological interpretation of the Bible? In this wise and provocative book, Starling invites us to see how Scripture interprets Scripture. Highlighting various interpretive dispositions and practices at work within the two Testaments, he offers us models for our own continuing apprenticeship in reading the Bible as Scripture. The result (to change metaphors) is a hermeneutical feast to be tasted, tested, savored, and shared with others."<br>--<b>Michael J. Gorman</b>, St. Mary's Seminary and University, Baltimore<br><br>"Among Protestant interpreters, it is axiomatic that the best interpreter of Scripture is Scripture itself. Starling develops this proverb in a provocative, fertile direction--urging, first, that we attend to how Scripture itself has already interpreted Scripture and, second, that we learn from the patterns and habits of theological interpretation we find in Scripture. He insightfully demonstrates how our interpretive practices might be shaped through these exercises in practical wisdom."<br>--<b>Joel B. Green</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"<i>Hermeneutics as Apprenticeship </i>paves a distinctive pathway into the conversation on biblical hermeneutics. Starling enlists the Reformation sensibility that Scripture interprets Scripture and sets about studying the internal hermeneutic of select biblical authors. This case study approach is as refreshing as it is insightful. He leads the reader through central motifs that emerge from his study--from a hermeneutics of virtue in Ruth to a hermeneutics of empire in 1&nbsp;Peter. He suggests that we would do well to apprentice ourselves to the biblical authors and<i> </i>offers a model for doing just that."<br>--<b>Jeannine Brown</b>, Bethel Seminary-San Diego<b>David I.

It wasn&#x2019;t my face that was like theirs, or my clothes. (My usual look was a pocket T-shirt and cutoff jeans shorts, while the glossy girls wore kimono dresses, peacock-feather hats, and short pointy boots like white cockatoos.) It was my body. My stomach had caved in. My hip bones flared like wings. My legs met only at the knees and ankles: There was a teardrop-shaped gap between my thighs, and another between my calves. Knobby bones protruded dangerously from my wrists and elbows. My arms seemed longer, and from the ends of them, my enormous hands flopped, awkward as a marionette&#x2019;s. I was barely thirteen, five feet and five inches tall, and down to 90 pounds from 110.<br><br>My transformation thrilled me.<br><br>Still, I wasn&#x2019;t quite thin enough. So I kept going, and the changes became even more exciting. The colored hairbands I kept around my wrist got so loose that I could easily slide them up to my elbow. If I pressed my hand around the part of my arm where the shoulder met the biceps, I could touch my thumb with the pad of my ring finger. I could also put both hands around my thigh and touch thumb to thumb, pinky to pinky. I&#x2019;d measure myself like that again and again when no one was watching, usually in the bathroom stall at school; it reassured me that I hadn&#x2019;t somehow gotten fatter in the hours since I&#x2019;d been on the scale that morning. My ribs became so visible that I could count them not only from the front but also, if I used two mirrors, from the back as they curved out from the knotted rope of my spine.<br><br>I began to resemble someone else tacked up in my room: Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now there was an icon. There was a guy who knew something about style: the original long-haired, emaciated, rock- star type. But it wasn&#x2019;t just Jesus&#x2019; body that I admired; it was his suffering, too, and the way it made people love him. Jesus had been my first role model, and I still respected the guy, even if I was a full-fledged nonbeliever by then. As he hung from the crucifix my dead mother had positioned over my dresser, Jesus inspired me&#x2014;with his skeleton hanging out of his skin, his blood dripping from his crown of thorns, and his face turned imploringly upward in the moment before his death as he said, &#x201c;My God, my Father, why have you forsaken me?&#x201d;<br>I knew how Jesus felt, asking that question. When my mother died of cancer the summer I turned eight, I felt pretty forsaken myself. I had no idea she was dying. I knew she was sick, of course, but my parents told my sister and me that she just had a very bad cold, kind of like chicken pox, except the bumps were inside.<br><br>Her illness replaced me&#x2014;the baby&#x2014;and became the most important thing in my mother&#x2019;s life. Before she&#x2019;d gotten sick, she loved everything I did, whether it was the Little Tea- pot dance, or one of my typically opinionated comments (&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to grow up to be like you, Mommy, always driv- ing my kids around&#x201d;), or just burying my face in her neck to cry. But after she was diagnosed, I wasn&#x2019;t as easy to love; at least, it was harder to get her full attention. For the last four years of her life, she spent one week out of every month in the hospital getting chemotherapy&#x2014;a word I could say but not define&#x2014;and when she was home, she spent a lot of time in bed with the curtains drawn. She didn&#x2019;t like it when I was loud, and sometimes she was too weak to even kiss me back after I pressed my lips against her cheek. Her head would just stay on the pillow.<br><br>Whenever she wasn&#x2019;t feeling well, I tried to leave her alone. I tried not to need anything from her. I became self-conscious: worried about what effect my actions would have, and aware of my own presence in a room.<br><br>Everyone&#x2014;my parents, my other relatives, and the priests and nuns we knew, including my uncle Father Jimmy&#x2014;told me that my mother might get better if I was a very good girl and asked God to help us. I would have done anything to get my mother back the way she used to be, so I prayed. I also sang at church with my family on Sunday mornings, as loudly and clearly as I could, because the pastor said singing was praising God twice. (I just hoped that Juan-Juan Santiago, who sat across the aisle from us with his parents and little brother, wouldn&#x2019;t notice what a geek I was.) One of my favorite hymns was in praise of lasagna&#x2014;or so I thought, till my mother caught on to what I was saying, and explained that the word was actually hosana, which means, roughly, &#x201c;God is great.&#x201d; And to show the devil I hated him, I&#x2019;d jump up and down in the grass&#x2014;as close to Hell as I could get&#x2014;until I&#x2019;d exhausted myself. Then I&#x2019;d lie on the ground, blowing kisses up to the angels. Everyone said God was always watching over me, which was nice, especially since my mother wasn&#x2019;t anymore. My growing love for God, and His for me, was helping to fill the hole my mother was making. I&#x2019;d picture Him with the big white beard, in a white robe, in a white throne that floated on the clouds, smiling down at me, and I&#x2019;d smile back.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t just through physical actions that I tried to make myself God&#x2019;s favorite; there were also the things I&#x2019;d do in my head. During Mass, I&#x2019;d recite the Penitential Rite with the rest of the congregation: &#x201c;I have sinned through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done, and in what I have failed to do.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d feel gravely sorry about all my transgressions: how I&#x2019;d once again stuffed myself with chocolate-chip cookies and marshmallows in the morning, before my parents woke up; how I&#x2019;d punched my sister in the rear end; how I&#x2019;d stuck my tongue out at my father when he wasn&#x2019;t watching. I&#x2019;d pinch myself once on the thigh for each sin, and resolve to become a better person. I knew how important it was to God that my head be as pure as my actions, so whenever I had bad thoughts&#x2014;like how much I hated the new Indian kid in our class, Raj, because he smelled funny and was hairy&#x2014;I&#x2019;d start to pray, trying to push the evil away. I was trying so hard and God loomed so large in my mind (even larger than Juan-Juan) that I was confident I was one of His favorites.<br><br>But I started to wonder if that was true after my mother died that August, twenty days after my birthday. I was so unprepared that when my father first told me I laughed. &#x201c;Really, when can we pick her up from the hospital?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d; He only stared at me. &#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; I insisted. Still, he didn&#x2019;t speak, and my sister, sitting in his lap, started to cry. That unsettled me enough that I went to get a closer look at my father. When tears started coming down his face, too, I was terrified. Something had to be seriously wrong, but I was too young&#x2014;or too shocked&#x2014;to really understand what was going on.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t give up the hope that my mother might somehow pop out of her coffin until I first saw her in the wooden box at the wake. That&#x2019;s when I started to appreciate what being dead meant. The rosy blush my mother usually wore had been replaced by two heavy circles of red on her cheeks; instead of her favorite mauve lipstick, there was a brown smear on her mouth. I could see the pores on her face as clearly as if they&#x2019;d been made with a pencil. Her skin was thick and hard and unyielding under my fingertips, like football leather. I realized there was no way that body was going to sit up and say &#x201c;Surprise!&#x201d; and then reach out to tickle me under the arms. I climbed up on the kneeler and kissed her, maybe because I still had fairy-tale hopes about what that could do for a dead person. But it didn&#x2019;t make any difference. Those rubber lips took away any doubt I had left&#x2014;about her death, anyway.<br><br>But suddenly, everything else in my life was thrown into question. It wasn&#x2019;t only my mother who was gone: It was my understanding of the universe, of myself, of God, and even of my own father. Overwhelmed by his grief, bills, and the responsibility of trying to raise two girls alone, he became a stranger to me: moody, unpredictable, and frightening&#x2014;the big villain in my life. Suddenly, we were shouting at each other so much that I believed it when the first nanny we had after my mother died, a young woman from northern Ireland named Marie, told me again and again my father didn&#x2019;t love me. Every night, I waited for him to come home with the worst longing and the most terrible fear, wondering if he would prove Marie right one more time.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t count on my so-called Heavenly Father anymore, either, considering I was convinced that He&#x2019;d killed my mother to punish me. (He couldn&#x2019;t have had it out for anyone else in my family, I figured, since my connection to Him was more intense than theirs, for better and for worse.) What I couldn&#x2019;t figure out was why God was so angry with me. In what way had I offended Him? I kept going over and over everything that I&#x2019;d done and thought in the weeks leading up to my mother&#x2019;s death, the way a guilty lover will after a suicide, and though there were all the usual little bad things&#x2014;sneaking cookies, punching my sister, hating Raj&#x2014;there wasn&#x2019;t anything new and outstandingly wicked that would explain God&#x2019;s act of vengeance against me. Also, I was nowhere near as bad as some of the other kids in my town, especially not the ones from the public middle school, who smoked cigarettes on the railroad tracks behind my house, or had sex in the old band shell at Memorial Park, or did drugs in their cars in the Burger King parking lot.<br><br>Since it seemed obvious I couldn&#x2019;t have done anything to bring on the wrath of God, I figured there must be something inherently wrong with me. Did He hate me because I wasn&#x2019;t as good in my heart as I&#x2019;d thought? Probably. And maybe my mother hadn&#x2019;t really loved me, either. Why else would she have left without even saying good-bye, or that she&#x2019;d miss me?<br><br>Those kinds of questions were hard to face, so eventually I convinced myself, as best as I could, that the problem wasn&#x2019;t with me but with Catholicism. I&#x2019;d tried so hard to follow the rules, in my actions and my thoughts, and what had it got- ten me but a dead mother? I didn&#x2019;t want to live that way anymore. But I did want something to believe in&#x2014;a system that was more transparent and would yield visible results. I wanted proof that I was good.<br>Dieting eventually became a replacement religion for me, with its own set of commandments and rituals. It became a way for me to be my own god and my own creation&#x2014;Pygmalion and Galatea in the same human body. It became a perverse method for mothering myself: I structured my meals, my days, and my thoughts around it. Dieting became my internal compass. It became the new thing for me to be the best at. I was so devoted that I was practically ready to give up my life for it.<br><br>But when I first started losing weight, toward the end of eighth grade, I had no idea I would become a fanatic. It was far more simple than that. All I wanted was to look like I had at the beginning of the school year, before my abdomen began to protrude under the band of my Hanes underwear. Though I realize now it was just an early sign of puberty, that curve disgusted me. I felt like a dog in heat, with it poking out of me. I had to be out of control if I&#x2019;d let my body turn into that. And I figured if I lost five pounds&#x2014;just five&#x2014;my stomach would be flat again. But as it turned out, I had to drop closer to fifteen pounds before the curve disappeared, and once I got that far, I couldn&#x2019;t stop. I was addicted to losing.<br><br>Part of the appeal was how much dieting simplified my life. Nothing else mattered but the numbers: how many calories I&#x2019;d eaten that day; how many pounds I&#x2019;d lost in the last week, or month; how many leg lifts or push-ups I&#x2019;d do that night. I&#x2019;d add, subtract, and double-check constantly. I felt like I was moving toward some great new salvation. Instead of praying when I felt scared or guilty or lonely, I&#x2019;d turn to the numbers, like my grandmother to her wooden rosary beads, and they&#x2019;d calm me down.<br><br>My head became so full of equations and plans about what I would eat and what exercises I would do that I didn&#x2019;t have room for much else. I stopped worrying about not having any boobs even though every other girl in my class had them. I stopped caring about how all the boys, including Juan-Juan, had a crush on my best friend, Catherine McMurtry. I stopped feeling guilty about all the games of Truth or Dare and Seven Minutes in Heaven I&#x2019;d played, and how it made me feel weird and gross but also excited whenever there was a boy&#x2019;s tongue in my mouth. I stopped thinking about all those times Marie had told me that my father didn&#x2019;t love me. My calculations not only filled up all the empty spaces in my head; they also helped me determine the value of my self. On any day that I&#x2019;d eaten less, worked out longer, or lost more, it didn&#x2019;t mean I was good, but at least I wasn&#x2019;t bad.<br><br>The most important number, though, was one I had no idea how to determine: the weight I&#x2019;d have to be to let myself stop, the weight that would mean I was finally good enough. In the very beginning, I thought it would be 105. Then it became one hundred. Ninety-five. Ninety. By the time I weighed eighty-five, I started to wonder if I&#x2019;d ever be able to predict what the right weight was. Maybe I wouldn&#x2019;t know until I reached it.<br>That summer before high school, when the dieting fever really started to take hold, I was fighting more than ever with my father, an Irish immigrant who made his living paving people&#x2019;s driveways and laying concrete. Maybe part of the problem was that there was no other adult in the house to help keep us in our corners: My father hadn&#x2019;t (and still hasn&#x2019;t) remarried, and we were between housekeepers at that point. He hired and fired sixteen different women before I got to college, but never before I got attached to them; each one of them seemed like some kind of mother to me.<br><br>Our door started to revolve after he kicked out Marie, who&#x2019;d been with us for four years. She&#x2019;d become slowly obsessed with my father, and eventually demanded that he marry her, though they&#x2019;d never been romantically involved. She pleaded with him, saying that she was already acting like a mother to my sister and me; why not make her role official?<br><br>My father turned her down. One night shortly after the rejection, Marie pulled a huge knife out of the kitchen drawer and threatened to kill herself with it. I grabbed the cleaver away from her; my father ordered her out of the house, and we never saw her again, though for years she prank-called our house and one time even phoned Catherine McMurtry&#x2019;s house, looking for me.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a coincidence that my obsession with dieting started soon after my father fired Marie. Screwed up as she was, she&#x2019;d been a temporary stay against the confusion that ensued after my mother was gone. In the four years that she&#x2019;d been with us, I&#x2019;d come to depend on her, especially because I didn&#x2019;t feel like I could depend on my father anymore. It never occurred to me to ask him if Marie was right all those times she said he didn&#x2019;t love me; it seemed obvious he didn&#x2019;t. After all, I apparently had a special talent for saying things that would infuriate him so much that he&#x2019;d give me the silent treatment for days, even weeks. During those periods, he&#x2019;d do everything he could to avoid looking at me, even keeping his head down if we were in the kitchen together.<br><br>Often our arguments would start over things in the news. My father was a conservative then, despite the fact that he also subscribed to The New York Times, whereas I was a born liberal, despite the fact that I&#x2019;d represented Ronald Reagan in some faux presidential debate we&#x2019;d had at school.

All true enough&#x2014;but how does the reality conform to these stereotypes? The Spanish people are certainly distinctive. Visitors are often astounded by their vitality, entranced by their friendliness, and driven mad by their frequent indulgence of their friends and relatives. They tend to be proud, passionate, spontaneous, generous, and loyal; they can also be procrastinators, individualistic to a fault, suspicious, and, not least, very noisy! Spain has had a major impact on European and world history. This is the nation that enjoyed a golden age of enlightenment, that discovered America and gathered in its riches, and that left the great legacy of its culture and its language, today spoken by over four hundred million people. In the early twentieth century, Spain suffered a bitter civil war and a stultifying dictatorship, from which it emerged in the late seventies to become again an integral part of Europe and the international arena. <i>Culture Smart! Spain</i> explores the complex human realities of modern Spanish life. It describes how history and geography have created both regional differences and shared values and attitudes. It reveals what the Spaniards are like at home, and in business, and how they socialize. It prepares you for their boundless energy and widespread religious devotion; and offers practical tips on how to behave and make the very most of your visit. The better you understand the Spanish people, the more you will be enriched by your experience of this vital, warm, and varied country&#x2014;where the individual is important, and the enjoyment of life is paramount.</p><p><b>Bel�n&nbsp;Aguado Viguer</b> is a protocol, diplomacy, and tourism expert.

My older sister, Helen, came to my room, took me by the hand, and sat me down on the bed. She opened her mouth to say something, but then her face flushed, and she turned her head to look out the window. After a second, she squeezed my hand and looked back in my eyes. She said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve always been a good girl, Maude, and done what I told you. Now, you&#x2019;re going to be a married woman, and he will be the head of the house. When you go home tonight after your party, no matter what he wants to do to you, you have to let him do it. Do you understand?&#x201d;I didn&#x2019;t understand, but I nodded my head anyway.

When cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cobs and set aside. <p></p> Soak the saffron in the hot water for at least 15 minutes. <p></p> Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and saute for 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and set aside. <p></p> Using the same pan, heat another 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, bell peppers, and 1 teaspoon of the smoked paprika and saute until just tender, about 3 minutes.

Add 1&#x2044;2 cup of the simmering stock to the rice and cook, stirring, until the rice has absorbed it all.

Some, like his 1967 Bob Dylan poster for Columbia Records, are icons; others, like his series celebrating &#x201c;I Love New York,&#x201d; evoke his best-known work. <i>Milton Glaser Posters</i> includes them all, with Glaser&#x2019;s own commentary describing his thought process and inspiration. The book is a delight for the art lover, an education in visual expression, and an entertaining journey through the cultural life of half a century, all rolled into a single compact, intense volume.</p><p>Milton Glaser (b. 1929) is America&#x2019;s most celebrated graphic designer and an articulate spokesman for the ethical practice of design. He opened Milton Glaser, Inc., in 1974, and he continues to produce a prolific amount of work in many fields of design to this day. He has had one-man shows at the Museum of Modern Art and the Georges Pompidou Center, and in 2009 he was the first graphic designer to receive the National Medal of Arts. He lives in New York City with his wife, Shirley.&#34;Now he is launching a new book, Milton Glaser Posters, celebrating 427 examples of his poster designs from 1965 to 2017. We spoke to Milton about his career so far, his views on the changing industry and why ethics in design is more important than ever.&#34; Creative Boom &#34;It&#39;s this kind of mildly sardonic, self-deprecating commentary that makes Milton Glaser Posters an enjoyable read, though, of course, we&#39;re here for the pictures, which range from posters for Stevie Wonder and Mahalia Jackson concerts and the Newport Jazz Festival to an advert for dog food.&#34; Esquire, UK &#34;Milton Glaser&#39;s depiction of blind justice, designed in 1987 to commemorate the bicentennial of the American Constitution, comes Milton Glaser Posters with &#34;427 examples from 1965 to 2017&#34;&#34; Times Literary Supplement &#34;Since 1965, Milton Glaser has presented a prolific amount of work that has made him widely recognized as one the most honored graphic designer in his era. Glaser has designed more than 500 posters of which portray his sophisticated design and creativity. Some his most famous works include his 1967 Bob Dylan&#39;s poster for Columbia Records, and his series celebrating &#34;I � � New York.&#34; In this book, Glaser provides commentary on his influences while creating each poster. In addition, he include sketches of his original works that allow the viewer to have an insight into his creative process.&#34; Daily Beast &#34;A collection of more than 450 Milton Glaser posters will be showcased in a book celebrating his hugely iconic work. The book includes all of his poster designs accompanied by Milton&#39;s own commentary describing his creative process and visual expression, creating an insightful journey through the popular culture of half a century. Definitely a book for the coffee table or display shelf for any designers and illustrators.&#34; Digital Arts &#34;Whether Glaser&#39;s work invokes an emotional response in its audience or not is for each individual reader to decide - but ultimately, he says he hopes his new book will bridge that gap between informing and educating, and providing a source of enjoyment and entertainment for his readers. &#34;I hope people will derive a sense of happiness from it,&#34; he says. &#34;I want it to be pleasurable to read, both in an analytical sense, and in just seeing things that are harmonious, beautiful and worthy of repetition. I hope the book has duration, and can be interpreted differently over and over again.&#34; Design Week &#34;Cave paintings, thinks Milton Glaser, are the earliest posters. &#34;Those images create reactions today with the same potency they must have had when they were made. It&#39;s extraordinary that this form of communication has existed all through history.&#34; The celebrated US graphic designer - whose work includes the I Heart NY design and a psychedelic 1967 poster of Bob Dylan - has created countless posters, 450 of which are collected in a new book. Some have become emblematic of a certain time and place, while others have taken on a life of their own: &#34;People send me the strangest examples of `I Heart&#39;,&#34; he says, &#34;for example, in a hut in a small African village.&#34; A good poster, he says, needs to communicate effectively, be persuasive, and attract attention. But there&#39;s a distinction between graphic design and art: &#34; graphic design is now basically an adjunct of capitalism. Art is a means of examining reality freshly with open eyes.&#34;&#34; The Observer New Review &#34;Yet in the hands of a master, there is interplay between the commercial aims of design and the illuminative possibilities of art, and this can readily be seen in Glaser&#39;s posters, of which he has made more than 450 since 1965. In celebration, Abrams will release Milton Glaser Posters on March 27, an incredible compendium of poster art at its best.&#34; AnOther &#34;You may or may not know Mr Milton Glaser&#39;s name, but you will certainly know his work. I � � NY, that iconic, simple design that has been appropriated countless times? That was Mr Glaser. The graphic psychedelic poster of Mr Bob Dylan with flames of colour bursting from his head, one of the defining images of the late 1960s? Mr Glaser again. New York Magazine? Mr Glaser co-founded it. A wildly prolific graphic designer, the New York native has created some of the best-known commercial imagery ever, and is one of the most revered names in the design industry. Mr Glaser, 88, hasn&#39;t retired and continues to produce work today. Now, he has released a retrospective book documenting some of his most fascinating poster work.&#34; Mr Porter</p><h2>The Housing Lark</h2><p><b>The humorous yet poignant novel of West Indian migrant life in London that adds an iconic voice to the growing Caribbean canon<br><br>A Penguin Classic</b><br><br>Set in London in the 1960's, when the UK encouraged its Commonwealth citizens to emigrate as a result of the post-war labor shortage, <i>The Housing Lark</i> explores the Caribbean migrant experience in the "Mother Country" by following a group of friends as they attempt to buy a home together. Despite encountering a racist and predatory rental market, the friends scheme, often comically, to find a literal and figurative place of their own. Will these motley folks, male and female, Black and Indian, from Trinidad and Jamaica, dreamers, hustlers, and artists, be able to achieve this milestone of upward mobility? Unique and wonderful, comic and serious, cynical and tenderhearted, <i>The Housing Lark</i> poses the question of whether their "lark," or quixotic idea of finding a home, can ever become a reality.

P. Morgan and a friend of Ernest Hemingway. Living in Paris in the twenties and directing the Black Sun Press, which published James Joyce among others, Crosby was at the center of the wild life of the lost generation.

Unlike other meditations on the subject, <i>Flight Ways</i> incorporates the particularities of real animals and their worlds, drawing philosophers, natural scientists, and general readers into the experience of living among and losing biodiversity.<br><br>Each chapter of <i>Flight Ways</i> focuses on a different species or group of birds: North Pacific albatrosses, Indian vultures, an endangered colony of penguins in Australia, Hawaiian crows, and the iconic whooping cranes of North America. Written in eloquent and moving prose, the book takes stock of what is lost when a life form disappears from the world&#x2015;the wide-ranging ramifications that ripple out to implicate a number of human and more-than-human others. Van Dooren intimately explores what life is like for those who must live on the edge of extinction, balanced between life and oblivion, taking care of their young and grieving their dead. He bolsters his studies with real-life accounts from scientists and local communities at the forefront of these developments. No longer abstract entities with Latin names, these species become fully realized characters enmeshed in complex and precarious ways of life, sparking our sense of curiosity, concern, and accountability toward others in a rapidly changing world.</p><p>Thom van Dooren puts philosophy into conversation with the natural sciences and his ethnographic encounters to vivify the significance of extinction. <i>Flight Ways</i> incorporates the particularities of real animals and their worlds, each chapter focusing on a different species or group of birds.

For Ross, the story of the Commune is not a tragedy, because it is not finished.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Financial Times</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;<i>Communal Luxury</i> is a rich and complex book. It is an inspired rereading of the Paris Commune. It is a critique of historical accounts that ignore the ways in which the practices of insurrectionary movements generate their own theory. It is a call to historians to attend to the alternatives offered at decisive moments of political and economic consolidation. It is, as well, Ross&#x2019;s own manifesto about how we might think our futures differently. This is a history with enormous relevance for our contemporary political moment.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Joan W. Scott, Institute For Advanced Study, Princeton</b><br><br>&#x201c;Ross argues that the spirit of the Commune is alive today among ... the Indignados in Spain and inside the Occupy movement [and] discusses the &#x2018;political imaginary&#x2019; that fuelled and outlived the Commune.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Philippe Marli�re, <i>London Review of Books</i></b> <br><br> &#x201c;A timely, elegant and rather useful cartography of the Paris Commune ...

It is more about the possibility of other kinds of action in time, as indeed are most parables.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;McKenzie Wark </b><br><br> &#x201c;Rendered with economy and ease and an engaging array of portraiture that can only be noted here... For all its rich interest and value as a work of historical retrieval and remembrance, <i>Communal Luxury</i> is a book with designs on the future ... Ross anholds out the immensely appealing prospect of an integrally green communism in a society freed from capital, state and national passions, a general instance, perhaps, of her preferred intellectual orientation, which she presents as an undoctrinaire exchange between Marxism and anarchism.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Francis Mulhern, <i>New Left Review</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;One of the most important political books of the year...The ingenuity and collective good sense of the communards will challenge any reader who struggles to reconcile egalitarian politics with concerns over state violence and power.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;<i>Flavorwire</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A timely and fecund work that should stimulate anarchist thought and action on the relevance of the Commune to the contemporary politics of occupation, resistance, and prefiguration.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Anarchist Studies</i></b></p>&#x201c;Ross is the perfect guide for such a journey: few critics are more attuned to how words and images can travel ... [she] has an acute eye for this juxtaposition of the pastoral and the political, how the vines of nature can overtake the monuments of empire, how revolutionary events can interrupt the silence of the countryside.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Corey Robin, <i>Salon</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Ross brilliantly remaps the political topoi of the Commune in a narrative that is short but densely interwoven, a pattern of lively and vibrant connections not unlike the floral design by Morris on the book&#x2019;s cover.

From Jeff VanderMeer, an author praised by writers such as Laren Beukes, China Mi�ville and Michael Moorcock, City of Saints and Madmen is by turns sensuous and terrifying. This collection of four linked novellas is the perfect introduction to VanderMeer&#39;s vividly imagined world. In the city of Ambergris, a would-be suitor discovers a sunlit street can become a killing ground in the blink of an eye. An artist receives an invitation to a beheading and finds himself enchanted. And a patient in a mental institution is convinced he&#39;s imagined a city called Ambergris, invented its every last detail, and that he&#39;s really from a place called Chicago. Ambergris is a cruelly beautiful metropolis - a haven for artists and thieves, for composers and murderers. And once there, anything can happen. These tales of Ambergris include the World Fantasy Award-winning novella, The Transformation of Martin Lake .</p><p>THE COLLECTION THAT CHINA MIEVILLE CALLED "ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF 2001"--ENHANCED WITH 55,000 WORDS OF NEW MATERIAL and innovative artwork and design by seven artists and three designers. A SUMPTUOUS FEAST OF TEXT AND ILLUSTRATION. This collection contains VanderMeer's Theodore Sturgeon Award finalist novella "Dradin, In Love" and his World Fantasy Award winning novella "Transformation of Martin Lake". Garry Nurrish served as chief designer on this ground-breaking project. John Coulthart, of Hawkwind and Lovecraft illustration fame, contributed several title pages. Here are comments on prior Ambergris titles by reviewers and authors: <p>"City of Saints packs so much literary and emotional matter into the confines of one city, it defies both the standard category of 'collection' and the newer label 'story suite'. Other fantasy authors may stripmine their invented worlds...for the last scrap of ore; VanderMeer keeps going deeper, and finding new forms of gold." -Faren Miller, Locus. </p><p>"...enormously talented, possessing a painterly mastery of the Grotesque that makes his intensely-wrought dark fantasy an experience to be savored." - Nick Gevers, Locus Online, the Top 10 SF &amp; Fantasy Short Story Writers </p><p>"Ambergris is one of the great and unforgettable fantastic cities...it is a magnificent darkness." &#x2013; Redsine </p><p>"[a] truly wonderful creation, the strange and ancient city of Ambergris pulls [the reader] deeper and deeper into pause-producing insights or startlingly nasty and/or beautiful revelations." - Gahan Wilson, Realms of Fantasy </p><p>"Written with a richness of language and imagery uncommon for fantasy, and the equivalent of the best offered by contemporary literary stylists, the authors blends... traditions both literary and social with an equal measure of playfulness. Descriptive passages possess an originality and individual vitality for which it is hard to find parallel." - William Thompson, SF Site </p><p>TERRI WINDLING, Editor Year's Best Fantasy &amp; Horror "Walking into Jeff VanderMeer's Ambergris is like stepping inside of a surrealist painting by Leonora Carrington or Remedios Varo. I recommend the journey to all travelers with a taste for the fantastic." -Terri Windling, Editor, The Year's Best Fantasy &amp; Horror </p><p>S.P. SOMTOW "VanderMeer is a master craftsman. His finely-honed language, laser-sharp, penetrates to the painful core of human experience." </p><p>MICHAEL MOORCOCK "Examining VanderMeer one is reminded of the glories of Angkor and Anudhapura combined with the bustle and swagger of Captain Conrad's Indonesia, the adventurous intrigues of Byzantium and Venice, the brutal Spice Wars of the Dutch. But sometimes it is as if Proust intrudes, insensed and reminiscent. VanderMeer describes a world so rich and exaggerated and full of mysterious life that it draws you away from any intended moral or pasquinade deep into the wealth of the world's womb...Make the most of the tapestry of tales and visions before you. It is a rare treasure, to be tasted with both relish and respect. It is the work of an original. It's what you've been looking for." </p><p>CHINA MIEVILLE "Somewhere at the intersection of pulp and Surrealism, drawing on the very best of both traditions, is Jeff VanderMeer's Ambergris. Unsettling, erudite, dark, shot through with unexpected humour, the stories engross and challenge endlessly. Ambergris is one of my favourite haunts in fiction." </p><p>R.M. BERRY, New York Times notable novel Leonardo's Horse "A remarkable writer of highly original, utterly hilarious fiction, who continually pushes the boundaries of current literary fashion. The Early History and Dradin, In Love are literary tours de force, in which form and language stubbornly refuse relegation to instrumentality and reassert their irrepressible life. Few works I've read in recent years have given me such pure pleasure. </p><p>NORMAN SPINRAD, Asimov's SF Magazine "[The Early History of Ambergris] is the sort of thing that reminds us that while publishing modes, genres, literary schools and styles, and even the material matrices in which literature is encoded, come and go, there is a restorative impulse, a literary innocence, that transcends the maya thereof, that has not died yet, that remains eternal. Eternal because it generates literature that is written entirely for fun, without the slightest nod to the shrewdities of careerism...It restoreth the soul. It giveth hope." </p><p>PAUL DI FILIPPO "As the shady demiurge whoactually &#x2018;created' the historical personage known as Duncan Shriek, as well as the whole bloody history and complex culture of a complete world, the character of VanderMeer beggars the imagination. How could one fellow, even half divine, manage to combine the literary qualities of Nabokov, Borges, Barthelme, Cabell, Clark Ashton Smith, Suetonius, and Bernal Diaz into one person? It's impossible to credit!" </p><p>LANCE OLSEN "If Franz Kafka had a son, and Jorge Luis Borges raised him with Jessica Amanda Salmonson, I imagine the result would look a lot like Jeff VanderMeer - someone who writes with dark dream-time logic, Escher-like precision, and pure imaginative fire." </p><p>BRIAN STABLEFORD "I enjoyed The Early History of Ambergris tremendously and I think it's a marvellous piece of work, artfully combining humour and horror to excellent effect. Its mosaic format works beautifully to emphasize and extend the uncertainties of the fragmentary narrative. The greatest challenge facing any modern author is to produce a tale quite unlike any that has ever been produced before, but Jeff has met that challenge head on and answered it triumphantly. I hope the book is a great success, as it deserves to be - and whatever its immediate fate, I'm sure there will come a time when it will be an important and much-sought-after collector's item." </p><p>NEW YORK REVIEW OF SF "A text of lethally hypnotic fascination...a masterpiece of ironic perversity [set in] a brilliantly-realized city." </p><p>ST. JAMES GUIDE TO HORROR, GOTHIC, AND GHOST WRITERS "He will make a major contribution to the field of neo-Decadent dark fantasy." </p><p>RAIN TAXI "Vivid and beguiling, excellent exercise for the imagination, and efficient means of transportation to other realities. [VanderMeer] liberates us from the miserable reality of our days." </p><p>INTERZONE "The author's prose is delicate and ornate, but the narrative has force and wit in plenty...dramatizes and celebrates the anxiety and exhileration of entering the unknown - quite excellent." </p><p>THOMAS LIGOTTI </p><p>"...impressive work...I confess I tried to skim its pages - my usual procedure - but soon found that it was unskimmable and that every sentence needed to be read (and often reread)." </p><p>TANGENT "A really fine example of fantasy taken down the road a piece...well-drawn, tightly-focused...fantasy in fine fettle, healthy and vital, an intelligent, exciting exploration of the darker realms of the heart, with the good strong currents of myth and archetype to bear it along." </p><p>ED BRYANT, Locus "Set in the kind of no-time neverwhere city that Jorge Borges, Jack Vance, and Mervyn Peake might these days hiply program into their satellite locator systems...Lyrical, evocative, grim." </p><p>ASIMOV'S SF MAGAZINE "Assimilating and transcending such honorable influences as Clark Ashton Smith, Jack Vance, and E.R. Eddison, VanderMeer strides shoulder to shoulder with such currently working authors such as Paul Park, M. John Harrison, and Thomas Ligotti."</p>Jeff VanderMeer is an award-winning novelist and editor.

This attractive lift-the-flap title offers a basic introduction to plant growth. On each spread, rhythmic, poetic text describes a plant's flower or husk and shows a cross section that reveals the seeds inside. A few lines of text explain a plant's growth, and then the page folds out to reveal the mature plant--peas, raspberries, corn, peanuts, and so on--accompanied by a bouncy refrain, "where once a flower bloomed." Plenty of facts are left unexplained (for example, What is the relationship between pollen and the developing flowers and seeds?), but the simple, appealing text shows the basic progression of flower to fruit, and George's inviting, realistic color art brings youngsters up close to plants that produce familiar foods. Back matter gives gardening directions for the featured plants, and a final illustration counts through the months for preschoolers learning the seasons. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His oeuvre encompasses a wide variety of genres, including symphonic, chamber, operatic, and choral music.</p><h2>The Four Temperaments: A Rediscovery of the Ancient Way of Understanding Health and Character</h2><p>The system of the four temperaments, or humors&#x2014;melancholic, choleric, sanguine, and phlegmatic&#x2014;has been used to analyze personality and health for over two thousand years, since the philosophical insights of Aristotle and the healing arts of Hippocrates. It has been the basis of Western medicine and character portraits ever since. Now The Four Temperaments offers an introduction and overview of this ancient knowledge, providing readers a clear picture of all the humors have to offer. Randy Rolfe shows how to identify one's own temperament and how to dramatically improve health, relationships, career, and happiness with a basic understanding of the four temperaments. Since the author has been studying, applying, and teaching the wisdom of the temperaments for over thirty years, she is able to link these four ancient personality and health types with the findings of modern medical researchers. She guides readers to finding the proper balance between temperaments and using their strengths to overcome their vulnerabilities. Illustrations are included.</p><p><b>RANDY ROLFE, J.D., M.A.</b>, has been studying, applying, and teaching the wisdom of the temperaments for over thirty years. She has practiced law, had a family counseling practice, lectured around the country and abroad, and pursued the study of theology, nutrition, physiology, and biochemistry. Her four previous books include <i>You Can Postpone Anything But Love</i> and <i>The Seven Secrets of Successful Parents</i>. She lives with her husband of thirty-three years in West Chester, Pennsylvania.These two books are based on the ancient Greek concept of the four temperaments (sanguine, melancholic, phlegmatic, and choleric). First-time author Maddron refers to them as colors-orange, gold, green, and blue, respectively. Each has a "ruling sign" (air, earth, water, and fire) and is typified by physicality, high standards, intellectualism, and sensitivity respectively. Chapters cover the characteristics of each personality type as well as various combinations, and the author includes an instrument for self-analysis. Particularly intriguing is Maddron's discussion of how colors complement one another in functional society and the importance of understanding and appreciating the strengths and limitations of each. Despite the risks inherent in oversimplifying people and society, Maddron's treatment is nonetheless very thoughtful. Rolfe's passionate examination of the role and function of the four temperaments in life translates into half handbook, half treatise. Like Maddron, Rolfe (The 7 Secrets of Successful Parents) describes the traits and characteristics typical of each humor and accounts for the blending of multiple humors. Reasonable and encouraging in tone, the book emphasizes that "the humors can only add to and not detract from your deepest understanding as your life unfolds." Rolfe uses a holistic and ambitious approach that sometimes meets with uneven results. Discussing all the humors at once is often confusing, and the nutritional suggestions feel incomplete. While neither author tries to pigeonhole people, both present "a set of lenses for looking at the world" and its inhabitants. Both are recommended; Maddron's narrower scope results in a clear, entertaining read, while Rolfe is for readers seeking a serious treatment. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Southpaw</h2><p><i>The Southpaw</i> is a story about coming of age in America by way of the baseball diamond. Lefthander Henry Wiggen, six feet three, a hundred ninety-five pounds, and the greatest pitcher going, grows to manhood in a right-handed world. From his small-town beginnings to the top of the game, Henry finds out how hard it is to please his coach, his girl, and the sports page&#x2014;and himself, too&#x2014;all at once. Written in Henry&#x2019;s own words, this exuberant, funny novel follows his eccentric course from bush league to the World Series. Although Mark Harris loves and writes tellingly about the pleasures of baseball, his primary subject has always been the human condition and the shifts of mortal men and women as they try to understand and survive what life has dealt them.&nbsp;This new Bison Books edition celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <i>The Southpaw</i>. In his introduction to this edition, Mark Harris discusses the genesis of the novel in his own life experience. Also available in Bison Books editions are <i>The Southpaw</i>, <i>It Looked Like For Ever</i>, and <i>A Ticket for a Seamstitch</i>, the other three volumes in the Henry Wiggen series.</p><p>"First off I must tell you something about myself, Henry Wiggen, and where I was born and my folks." The opening sentence of the first installment of Harris's majestic quartet of baseball-centered novels may not be as imprinted on the literary consciousness as "Call me Ishmael," but the true aficionados of sporting belles-lettres deemed it, right from its 1953 publication, a quality start. They are the words that introduced both Wiggen, one of the true all-star characters of postwar American fiction, and the story-telling device that is his memoir. <p> Wiggen, a big, burly lefthander who grew up halfway between New York and Albany, pitches as much with his head as his arm, and he tends to be somewhat out of synch with everyone around him--parents, teammates, coaches, even his girlfriend; no one has a grip on him. The novel traces the arc of his life from the small town where he grew up to his thrashing around the bush leagues to the spotlight that's on him every time he takes the mound for the fabled, fictional New York Mammoths. Through Wiggen, Harris takes the pulse of postwar America; what he finds is sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing, sometimes poignant, and always absorbing. Like a good pitch, Harris hurls a classic novel with considerable pace, plenty of movement, and a knack for artfully catching life's corners instead of powering its way obviously right down the pipe. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Pick the Plot (4) (Story Thieves)</h2><p>When Owen finds himself stuck in a Pick Your Own Plot story, things get more complicated than ever in this fourth book in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, Story Thieves<i>&#x2014;</i>which was called a &#x201c;fast-paced, action-packed tale&#x201d; by <i>School Library Journal&#x2014;</i>from the author of the Half Upon a Time trilogy.<br><br>Being able to jump into books used to seem like the greatest thing in the world to Owen Conners.

The last few days came crashing back, and he squeezed his eyes shut. Wherever he was, he didn&#x2019;t want to know. There were too many bad possibilities and not nearly enough good ones. The bad ones:<br> <br>1.&nbsp;He was trapped in a book. The last he&#x2019;d seen Bethany, the Dark had defeated her. And then Nobody had thrown Owen into a Pick the Plot book. That meant Owen could be in a story where he had zero control over his own choices, with readers deciding for him. This was the worst of the bad possibilities.<br> <br>2.&nbsp;He was back home, but Bethany was still missing. Maybe the whole Pick the Plot thing had been Nobody trying to scare him, and instead of a book, Nobody had sent Owen back to the nonfictional world. So he was now actually lying in his own bed, which was good&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there&#x2019;d be no way he could help Bethany. Slightly less worse, only because at least he was safe in his own bed.<br> <br>3.&nbsp;He was back home, with Bethany still missing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Nobody had completely separated the nonfictional and fictional worlds. Depending on what that meant, this might actually be the worst option.<br> <br>As Owen had learned while stuck in a sort of behind-the-scenes comic book land, Nobody had been trying to permanently separate the worlds, and Bethany was one of the last portals holding them together. So if Nobody had found Bethany, then split her in half like he&#x2019;d said he was going to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what would happen? What if Owen opened his eyes and discovered a world without books, without movies, without anything made-up? Would that stuff all just disappear? And would the fictional people on the other side be okay too? Not to mention would Bethany be okay, split in half like that?<br> <br>All in all, that was three good reasons not to open his eyes, right there. Owen squeezed them shut even harder, balling his hands into fists, before taking a deep breath, trying to calm down.<br> <br>Just because the bad possibilities were awful didn&#x2019;t mean there weren&#x2019;t still good possibilities. He should list those off too, just to be fair:<br> <br>1.&nbsp;The last few days had all been a bad, bad dream.<br> <br>2.<br> <br>3.<br> <br>Okay, having only one good possibility wasn&#x2019;t very encouraging. And things like this were never bad dreams. That was just lazy writing in books.<br> <br>Owen slowly lay back down on the bed, purposely not paying attention to how scratchy this blanket was, and how his blanket at home was definitely not scratchy at all. C&#x2019;mon, bad dream.<br> <br>And then another loud, strange noise came from what felt like yards away, and Owen&#x2019;s robotic heart began pounding. The sound had been a horrifying cross between a scream and a growl, and definitely wasn&#x2019;t his fictional cat, Spike.<br> <br>He clenched his fists tighter, still not opening his eyes. Maybe the sound had just been some dog that needed to go out! Or a cat fighting something bigger, like a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a tiger, or a truck! Not likely, but still possible! Either way, there was no proof that he was currently trapped in a terrible book where readers could control his whole life. Nope. No proof at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at home,&#x201d; Owen whispered to himself. &#x201c;Bethany&#x2019;s at her house, and we&#x2019;re both totally, completely fine.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Harold Lasswell (1902-1978) was a prominent scholar in the area of propaganda research. He focused on conducting both quantitative and qualitative analyses of propaganda, understanding the content of propaganda, and discovering the effect of propaganda on the mass audience. Lasswell is credited with creating the mass communication procedure of content analysis. Lasswell maintained that a content analysis should take into account the frequency with which certain symbols appear in a message, the direction in which the symbols try to persuade the audience&#39;s opinion, and the intensity of the symbols used. By understanding the content of the message, Lasswell sought to achieve the goal of understanding the &#34;stream of influence that runs from control to content and from content to audience.&#34; Lasswell&#39;s most well-known content analyses were an examination of the propaganda content during World War One and Two. In &#34;Propaganda Technique in the World War,&#39; Lasswell examined propaganda techniques through a content analysis, and came to some striking conclusions. Lasswell was similar to Ellul, in that he showed that the content of war propaganda had to be pervasive in all aspects of the citizen&#39;s life in order to be effective. Furthermore, Lasswell sought to demonstrate that as more people were reached by this propaganda, the war effort would become more effective. Aside from understanding the content of propaganda, Lasswell was also interested in how propaganda could shape public opinion. This dealt primarily with understanding the effects of the media. Lasswell was particularly interested in examining the effects of the media in creating public opinion within a democratic system.</p><p></p><h2>Sir Thomas Wyatt: The Complete Poems</h2><p>As a diplomat in Renaissance Europe, and a luminary at the court of Henry VII, Sir Thomas Wyatt wrote in an incestuous world where everyone was uneasily subject to the royal whims and rages. Wyatt had himself survived two imprisonments in the Tower as well as a love affair with Anne Boleyn, and his poetry - that of an extraordinarily sophisticated, passionate and vulnerable man - reflects these experiences, making disguised reference to current political events. Above all, though, Wyatt is known for his love poetry, which often dramatizes incidents and remembered conversations with his beloved, with an ear acutely sensitive to patterns of rhythm and colloquial speech. Conveying the actuality of betrayal or absence, and the intense pressure of his longing for a love that could be trusted, these are some of the most haunting poems in the English language.</p><p>Epigram: 11<br> Canzone: 1<br> Canzone: 3<br> Sonnet: 16<br> Sonnet: 17<br> Sonnet: 19<br> Sonnet: 2<br> Sonnet: 21<br> Sonnet: 29<br> Sonnet: 24<br> Epigram: 3<br> Ballade: 1<br> Ballade: 10<br> Ballade: 11<br> Ballade: 12<br> Ballade: 13<br> Ballade: 14<br> Ballade: 15<br> Ballade: 16<br> Ballade: 17<br> Ballade: 18<br> Ballade: 19<br> Ballade: 2<br> Ballade: 20<br> Ballade: 21<br> Ballade: 22<br> Ballade: 23<br> Ballade: 24<br> Ballade: 25<br> Ballade: 26<br> Ballade: 27<br> Ballade: 28<br> Ballade: 29<br> Ballade: 3<br> Ballade: 30<br> Ballade: 31<br> Ballade: 32<br> Ballade: 33<br> Ballade: 34<br> Ballade: 35<br> Ballade: 36<br> Ballade: 37<br> Ballade: 38<br> Ballade: 39<br> Ballade: 4<br> Ballade: 40<br> Ballade: 41<br> Ballade: 42<br> Ballade: 5<br> Ballade: 6<br> Ballade: 7<br> Ballade: 8<br> Ballade: 9<br> Canzone: 2<br> Canzone: 3<br> Canzone: 4<br> Canzone: 5<br> Canzone: 6<br> Canzone: 7<br> Canzone: 8<br> The Deserted Lover Consoleth Himself ...<br> Egerton Manuscript: 102<br> Egerton Manuscript: 104.

The setting of this exchange was Edinburgh, in a Victorian house surrounded by rhododendrons and a few leafy trees: an oak, several copper beeches, and a single specimen tree known variously as the dove tree or ghost tree. &#x201c;Popular with doves,&#x201d; said Isabel, adding, &#x201c;and, I assume, with ghosts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If looked at from above, as from an intrusive, snap-happy satellite, the garden would be seen to be bounded on one side by a tree-lined avenue and on its three other sides by a high stone wall. This wall was a highway for cats and for Brother Fox, the fox who lived somewhere nearby and with whom Isabel from time to time communed&#x2014;to the extent that foxes, in their reserve, will allow anybody to commune with them. The wall was also a parcelling-out, in neat rectangular shapes, of contested suburban territory&#x2014;mine here, yours there, this shared. Beyond that wall were further gardens; then came roads and buildings of grey or honey-coloured stone, spreading out like skirts until they reached hills on one side and sea on the other. This was the North Sea, cold, blue, lapping at the jagged edge of the country, a reminder of where Scotland lay in the true nature of things; a place that was mostly water and wind and high empty sky; a place where the land itself seemed to be an afterthought, a farewell gesture from Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel was seated in a chair and her young son, Charlie, now almost four years old, was at her feet, under the table, a place that he described as his office and where he did his office work. Jamie, her husband&#x2014;although she still thought of him as her lover&#x2014;was standing near the large window overlooking the garden. The whole family was present and had been thinking, from their various perspectives, about lunch.<br> &nbsp;<br> And thinking of other things too. In Isabel&#x2019;s case, she had been paging through a current affairs magazine in which she had come across an article on the return of cultural treasures. Unsurprisingly, this article touched on the Elgin Marbles: we want them back, said Greece&#x2014;everybody knew their position on that&#x2014;while the British Museum, with typical British skill at changing the subject, seemed to be talking about other things altogether. But it was not these much-discussed Marbles that concerned Isabel&#x2014;rather it was a paragraph about a Maori wood carving that long ago had been taken from a meeting house and had ended up in a museum in Berlin. This carving was of spiritual significance for the Maori and a request had been made for it to be returned to New Zealand. The holding museum said that it was considering the matter, but was still doing so two years after the request had first been made. That was the point at which Isabel, reading about it before she got up to heat the soup for their lunch, said, aloud, &#x201c;Give it back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She had not addressed anybody in particular, although the advice appeared directed to the museum in Germany. It was one of those comments that we may utter to express strong views and that we do not expect to be overheard or reacted to. But Charlie heard it, and thought that his mother was telling him to give back the roller-ball pen that he had found and with which he was now beginning to draw small lines, tiny tattoos, across his kneecaps. He saw no reason to return the pen as it was his knees on which he was drawing; he understood that there was a general prohibition against graffiti, but this was himself he was decorating and that, he thought, was his business. It was for this reason that he said, &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Not knowing any of this, Jamie had interjected with his &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel glanced under the table and saw what Charlie was doing. &#x201c;Not on your knees, darling,&#x201d; she said, slipping him a piece of paper. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t draw on our knees, do we? Draw on that. Draw a fox.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The idea appealed, and the knee tattoos were forgotten. She looked at Jamie. &#x201c;I was reading about a carving in a museum that people want returned.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie nodded. &#x201c;Oh yes. But wouldn&#x2019;t it empty all the museums if we started to hand things back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It would diminish them, perhaps&#x2014;not empty them. Most museums have more things than they can show. The big ones have vast warehouses packed with treasures.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie peered at a thin rime of dirt on the window glass. An unusual wind had brought dust all the way up from the Sahara and dropped it across Western Europe, even as far as Scotland. He would have to wash the windows soon, as that was his job. Isabel was in charge of the garden, while Jamie did the windows and put the bins out on the street on collection days.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh yes?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel laid aside her magazine. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s interesting,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;People like the Maori, and the Aboriginal people in Australia too, I suppose, see so many things about them as sacred. The land, the trees, river, carvings&nbsp;. . . And yet we don&#x2019;t have any of that ourselves, do we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie peered even more closely at the glass. He had washed that particular window two or three weeks ago; winds from the Sahara had no business coming this far north. Who bids the mighty ocean deep/Its own appointed limits keep&nbsp;. . . The words came back to him unexpectedly; he had been a choirboy in his time and choirboys remembered what they were obliged to sing, or some of it. Winds had their appointed limits too, he thought, not just oceans.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe we had lots of sacred places,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And then we just forgot about them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Stonehenge? Iona? Those odd stone circles that you sometimes more or less trip over?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. All of those.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just people like the Maori who have ancestors. What do they call the other New Zealanders&#x2014;the rest? People like Jenny?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It happened that Isabel knew. She had a New Zealand cousin who had visited her several times and they had shared a memorable conversation about belonging.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pakeha,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Maori word for&nbsp;. . . for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pakeha have ancestors too&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie remembered Jenny&#x2019;s visit. &#x201c;I wonder what she&#x2019;s up to,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s writing a cookery book,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;And she still has that television show. The Creative Kitchen. She says that it&#x2019;s very popular in Spain, for some reason. She&#x2019;s dubbed into Spanish.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But it was not Jenny she wanted to talk about; it was what Jamie had said about ancestors. &#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We all have the same number of ancestors, don&#x2019;t we? We don&#x2019;t go on about them, but we have them, surely. I mean, there&#x2019;s no monopoly on ancestors. One can&#x2019;t be ancestor-rich, so to speak.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He left the window and came to sit down at the table, opposite Isabel. &#x201c;It depends on whether you think they exist. If you think that they&#x2019;re not there anymore&#x2014;because they&#x2019;ve died&#x2014;as ancestors tend to do&#x2014;then&nbsp;. . . well, then you can&#x2019;t really have them in your life, can you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So what counts, then,&#x201d; said Isabel, &#x201c;is whether you have an eschatological dimension to your Weltanschauung.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For the second time in those few minutes, Jamie said, &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She laughed. &#x201c;Sorry, I couldn&#x2019;t resist it. You can get your revenge by saying something utterly opaque about Wagner, if you like. Or, perhaps more likely, somebody like Schoenberg.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Escha&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Eschatological,&#x201d; supplied Isabel. &#x201c;And I use it loosely, and just to keep you on your toes. It&#x2019;s more about last things, but I suppose the ancestors come into that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put it simply,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, if you think that we survive in some way&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After we&#x2019;ve kicked the bucket?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel hesitated, momentarily brought up sharp by the thought that there was a bucket waiting to be kicked by all of them&#x2014;including Jamie and Charlie; morbid thought, she told herself&#x2014;we&#x2019;re young, or sort of young. She decided to laugh, both at his use of the expression and as an act of defiance of mortality. &#x201c;To use a philosophical term of art,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Yes. If you think we survive death in some way, then you may well be concerned with ancestors. But that depends on whether you think they continue to have any interest in us. That&#x2019;s the important thing, I think.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean they may say, That&#x2019;s it, goodbye?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. And if they did, then there&#x2019;s no point in talking about the ancestors. Yet a lot of people don&#x2019;t think that way&#x2014;they feel there&#x2019;s some connection between their ancestors and themselves. They still feel somehow involved with them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watching over us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She thought so. &#x201c;Or still occupying the places where they lived,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Hence the spiritual significance of place. Holy mountains&#x2014;that sort of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie nodded. &#x201c;Some of my friends who play rugby talk about Murrayfield Stadium as sacred turf.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, it is a special place for them, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Rugby is such a tribal game. All those men getting physical with one another. Painting their faces with the Saltire. Singing &#x2018;Flower of Scotland.&#x2019; Bagpipes. Pure tribalism, surely.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They were both silenced, perhaps by the realisation that anthropological observation applies as much to us as to them. From under the table there came a faint humming. They both recognised it at the same time as &#x201c;Pop Goes the Weasel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He loves that tune,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Half a pound of tuppenny rice, Charlie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A small voice responded tunefully, &#x201c;Half a pound of treacle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie continued the nursery rhyme: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the way the money goes.&#x201d; And Isabel said, &#x201c;That means nothing to him. He has no idea of money yet&#x2014;lucky him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Expensive,&#x201d; said Charlie.<br> &nbsp;<br> They looked at one another in astonishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Prodigy,&#x201d; whispered Jamie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Porridge,&#x201d; came the small voice from below.<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel winked at Jamie. &#x201c;His ancestors&#x2014;his Scottish ancestors&#x2014;ate an awful lot of porridge. Porridge links us to them.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Porridge binds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie remembered something. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that person you keep quoting&#x2014;the one who wrote that book? The Art of Living?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lin Yutang.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, him. You once told me something that he said about patriotism and food. What was it again?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel smiled at the recollection. She had not read Lin Yutang for some time, but she knew where he was on her bookshelf. That, she felt, meant that he had not been forgotten. &#x201c;He said: What is patriotism but love of the food one ate as a child?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He thought about that. &#x201c;Very good. Yes, spot on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But she was not so sure; Isabel was a philosopher, and philosophers were distrustful of broad propositions. &#x201c;Well&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, he&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;You love your country because it&#x2019;s your country, because it&#x2019;s familiar and it&#x2019;s full of things you&#x2019;ve always known. That includes childhood food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel was prepared to concede that this came into it, but was it enough to explain why people&#x2014;or some of them, at least&#x2014;were prepared to sacrifice everything for their country, even their lives? But food was just a shorthand expression for the familiar. Was patriotism, when boiled down, merely a love of one&#x2019;s own familiar things&nbsp;. . . above the familiar things of others? The familiar things of others, of course, counted for less, it seemed: people were usually patriotic in the face of the assertions of others&#x2014;who also loved what they ate in their own, foreign childhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even that, she suspected, was a reduction too far. What about people who were patriotic because they loved the values their country espoused? She remembered, as she asked the question, a conversation she had had years earlier with an elderly man in the Scottish Arts Club. They had got on to the subject of national characteristics and he had revealed that as a refugee from Central Europe he appreciated the kindness and tolerance he had found in Britain. &#x201c;That is why I have become a British patriot,&#x201d; he had said. People had forgotten that there had been many who thought that way.<br> &nbsp;<br> She expressed her doubts to Jamie. &#x201c;I think the food of childhood is probably just a metaphor for one&#x2019;s people and place. I think that lies at the heart of patriotism. Our own people, our own place&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what stirs patriotism.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie looked thoughtful. &#x201c;Maybe. But it sounds so neat and tidy, doesn&#x2019;t it? It sounds so apt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All aphorisms do. They must have a kernel of truth in them&#x2014;somewhere&#x2014;but they often don&#x2019;t provide the full picture.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;I can imagine somebody like Lin Yutang getting up in the morning and thinking: What aphorisms shall I come up with today?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie laughed. &#x201c;Like Oscar Wilde, perhaps? Can&#x2019;t you imagine him getting out of bed in the morning and asking himself what witticisms he should let slip by breakfast.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Although I somehow doubt that Wilde got out of bed in the morning. These people tended to get up in the afternoon, I think. Look at Proust&#x2014;also a rather louche character. He got out of bed in the evening, if at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right&#x2014;afternoon, then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, I can picture it. Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s last words, of course, were very well chosen. I can see him lying there in Paris, contemplating the wallpaper with distaste, and thinking It&#x2019;s almost time, I&#x2019;d better come up with something good. And then saying, &#x2018;Either that wallpaper goes, or I do.&#x2019; And then he went.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;Except for one thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie grinned. He would have liked Oscar Wilde, he thought&#x2014;in small doses. But it would have been exhausting to listen to him for too long. That was the trouble with very witty people&#x2014;they tire the rest of us. Boswell, he had always imagined, must have found it rather wearying to be in Dr.&nbsp;Johnson&#x2019;s company day after day on their trip through Scotland. Oh just shut up, will you, we&#x2019;ve got miles to go and you keep coming up with these wise observations&nbsp;. . . <br> &nbsp;<br> He frowned. &#x201c;One thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They weren&#x2019;t his actual last words. Apparently he said that a few weeks before he died.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jamie shook his head. &#x201c;Nice try, though.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Isabel brought the conversation back to Lin Yutang. She would look for his book that evening, she decided. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else Lin said that I must look up. He wrote an essay on flowers, I seem to recall, and he lists the conditions that displease flowers. Isn&#x2019;t that a marvellous notion&#x2014;that flowers should be displeased by certain things?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Flowers with attitude,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Sure. But what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember everything on the list&#x2014;in fact, I can only remember one thing he said flowers definitely don&#x2019;t like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br> ...</p><h2>Tales of the Jazz Age (A Penguin Classics Hardcover)</h2><p>&#39;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&#39; sees a baby born in 1860 begin life as an old man and then age backwards.

While spirituality has been generally recognized as an essential dimension of palliative care, uniformity of spiritual care practice has been lacking across health care settings due to factors like varying understandings and definitions of spirituality, lack of resources and practical tools, and limited professional education and training in spiritual care.</p> <p>In order to address these shortcomings, more than forty spiritual and palliative care experts gathered for a national conference to discuss guidelines for incorporating spirituality into palliative care. Their consensus findings form the basis of <i>Making Health Care Whole</i>. This important new resource provides much-needed definitions and charts a common language for addressing spiritual care across the disciplines of medicine, nursing, social work, chaplaincy, psychology, and other groups. It presents models of spiritual care that are broad and inclusive, and provides tools for screening, assessment, care planning, and interventions. This book also advocates a team approach to spiritual care, and specifies the roles of each professional on the team.</p> <p> </p> <p>Serving as both a scholarly review of the field as well as a practical resource with specific recommendations to improve spiritual care in clinical practice, <i>Making Health Care Whole</i> will benefit hospices and palliative care programs in hospitals, home care services, and long-term care services. It will also be a valuable addition to the curriculum at seminaries, schools of theology, and medical and nursing schools.</p></p><p><p></p><p>Christina Puchalski, MD, is executive director of the George Washington Institute for Spirituality and Health<br>(GWISH).

As a class of churches that profess allegiance to Reformed theology, practice, and piety, we have drifted from our moorings. This book is written to facilitate change, specifically reformation according to God&#39;s Word as summarized in the Reformed confessions.</p><p>R.

He is Associate Pastor of Oceanside United Reformed Church"While I am enthusiastic about what has been called the 'young Reformed awakening,' we still await a renaissance of genuinely confessional Reformed theology, piety, and practice. Scott Clark's historical work, diagnosis and critique, and constructive recommendations are all worth rigorous and respectful engagement. I welcome this robust entry into the discussion of what it means for us to be confessional and Reformed in the twenty-first century." --J. Ligon Duncan III, senior minister, First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi<br><br>"At a time when 'all that is solid melts in the air' and distinct colors fade to grey, R. Scott Clark reminds us of the loveliness, depth, and richness of Reformed Christianity. Not only TULIP, but a confession that bears fruit in both faith and practice, the account that you will find in this book may challenge, but its point is not to be missed." --Michael Horton, J. Gresham Machen professor of systematic theology and apologetics, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>"In a day when many follow charming personalities, fundamentalism, heterodoxy, individualism, and postmodernity and attempt to commandeer the Reformed tradition, Dr. Clark brings a much-needed corrective. He bases a Reformed identity in its understanding of the Scriptures through its historic confessions and creeds and a robust understanding of historic Reformed worship. Well researched, thoughtfully presented, and provocative, this work is a must-read for ministers, elders, and anyone who claims to be Reformed." --J. V.

Without his wife Clementine, however, he might never have become Prime Minister. By his own admission, the Second World War would have been &#x2018;impossible without her&#x2019;. Clementine was Winston&#x2019;s emotional rock and his most trusted confidante; not only was she involved in some of the most crucial decisions of war, but she exerted an influence over her husband and the Government that would appear scandalous to modern eyes. Yet her ability to charm Britain&#x2019;s allies and her humanitarian efforts on the Home Front earned her deep respect, both behind closed doors in Whitehall and among the population at large.<br><br> That Clementine should become Britain&#x2019;s &#x2018;First Lady&#x2019; was by no means pre-ordained. Born into impecunious aristocracy, her childhood was far from gilded. Her mother was a serial adulteress and gambler, who spent many years uprooting her children to escape the clutches of their erstwhile father, and by the time Clementine entered polite society she had become the target of cruel snobbery and rumours about her parentage. In Winston, however, she discovered a partner as emotionally insecure as herself, and in his career she found her mission. Her dedication to his cause may have had tragic consequences for their children, but theirs was a marriage that changed the course of history. &nbsp;Now, acclaimed biographer Sonia Purnell explores the peculiar dynamics of this fascinating union.</p></p><p>SONIA PURNELL started work at The Economist Intelligence Unit, edited a weekly financial magazine when only twenty-five, and then went on to a senior position on the Daily Telegraph&#39;s City pages before reporting on the EU from Brussels. On her return to London she assumed the position of Whitehall Correspondent, before moving to the Daily Mail, where she was Whitehall Editor. Her first book, Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition, was a candid and widely acclaimed portrait of London Mayor Boris Johnson, informed by her time working alongside him in Brussels. Just Boris was long listed for the Orwell Prize. She now writes and broadcasts as a freelancer and lives in London with her husband and two sons.&#34;Engrossing... Clementine Churchill became her husband&#39;s essential confidante and adviser, vetting his speeches, smoothing over his faux pas, dealing with his constituents... Purnell&#39;s book is the first formal biography of a woman who has heretofore been relegated to the sidelines.&#34; The New York Times &#34;Purnell has delivered an astute, pacey account of a woman who hardly ever emerged from the shadows. It is a sharp analysis of what it meant to be a politician&#39;s wife... [and] shows how much we can learn about Winston Churchill from his wife and marriage.&#34; The Wall Street Journal &#39;Both scrupulous and fair-minded, Sonia Purnell has done her subject proud in this eye-opening and engrossing account of the strong-willed and ambitious woman without whom - so Purnell argues with authority - Winston Churchill&#39;s political career would have been a washout. It is clear from this admirable account that Churchill would never have risen to greatness without Clementine.&#39; -- Miranda Seymour Daily Telegraph &#39;It seems remarkable that no one has given this remarkable woman proper biographical treatment before. One of the great political partnerships ... sensitively explored by Sonia Purnell.&#39; -- Daisy Goodwin The Times &#39;Eye opening biography. First Lady is a bold biography of a bold woman; at last Purnell has put Clementine Churchill at the centre of her own extraordinary story, rather than in the shadow of her husband&#39;s.&#39; -- Frances Wilson Mail on Sunday &#39;Sonia Purnell has written a highly readable, well researched, and insightful biography. This is an immensely enjoyable and deeply researched account.&#39; -- Anne Sebba &#39;Compellingly readable... the heroic saga of a warrior queen who wanted power but only got it by playing subtle diplomatic games as her husband&#39;s eminence grise during two world wars.&#39; -- Michele Roberts Independent &#39;Well researched and fluently written. Eminently readable.&#39; -- Dominic Sandbrook Sunday Times &#39;An intriguing study of a character both deeply flawed and, in her way, magnificent.&#39; -- Jane Shilling Evening Standard &#39;From the influence she wielded to the secrets she kept, a new book looks at the extraordinary role of Winston Churchill&#39;s wife Clementine who proved that behind every great man is a great woman. Giving Winston confidence and conviction was a key element of her support. The safety and security that Clementine provided - as an emotional blanket and political sounding board - was vital in allowing Churchill to be the dominant politician of his age. Churchill&#39;s chief of staff, General Pug Ismay said later: &#34;Without her... the history of Winston Churchill and of the world would have been a very different story.&#34;&#39; -- Dan Townend Daily Express &#39;Outstanding.&#39; Yorkshire Post &#39;Purnell is an exhaustive researcher and eloquent storyteller. This biography is partly a history of domesticity, and this is its great strength. Winston clearly loved his wife. More to the point, he needed her. Purnell shows convincingly how much &#39;great men&#39; rely on the everyday emotional labour of the women closest to them. Purnell wants to say much more than this, however: she wants Clementine to be recognised as a &#39;great woman&#39;. More interesting, though, is what this look at Britain&#39;s &#39;first lady&#39; tells us about the role of leaders&#39; wives in the UK compared to in the US.&#39; BBC History Magazine &#39;A unique take on Mrs Churchill&#39;s time as Britain&#39;s &#39;First Lady&#39;.&#39; Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine &#34;This exemplary biography illustrates how Clementine&#39;s intelligence, hard work, and perseverance in often difficult circumstances made her every bit a match for her remarkable, intimidating husband, and a fascinating figure in her own right.&#34; Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</p><h2>The Normal Christian Church Life</h2><p><strong>The Normal Christian Church Life</strong> is a record of messages given during conferences held in Shanghai and Hankow.

In its stead is an autoerotic theory of sexual development, a sexuality transcending binary categorization. This is psychoanalysis freed from ideas that have often brought it into conflict with the ethical and political convictions of modern readers, practitioners, and theorists.<br><br> The non-Oedipal psychoanalysis Freud outlined in 1905 possesses an emancipatory potential for the contemporary world that promises to revitalize Freudian thought. The development of self is no longer rooted in the assumption of a sexual identity; instead the imposition of sexual categories on the infant mind becomes a source of neurosis and itself a problem to overcome.<br><br> The new edition of <i>Three Essays</i> presents us with the fascinating possibility that Freud suppressed his first and best thoughts on this topic, and that only today can they be recognized and understood at a time when societies have begun the serious work of reconceptualizing sexual identities.</p><p><b>Sigmund Freud</b> was born in Freiberg, which is now known as the Czech Republic, on May 6, 1856.

Today, as Benjamin Ginsberg warns in this eye-opening, controversial book, "deanlets"--administrators and staffers often without serious academic backgrounds or experience--are setting the educational agenda.<br><br><em>The Fall of the Faculty</em> examines the fallout of rampant administrative blight that now plagues the nation's universities. In the past decade, universities have added layers of administrators and staffers to their payrolls every year even while laying off full-time faculty in increasing numbers--ostensibly because of budget cuts. In a further irony, many of the newly minted--and non-academic--administrators are career managers who downplay the importance of teaching and research, as evidenced by their tireless advocacy for a banal "life skills" curriculum. Consequently, students are denied a more enriching educational experience--one defined by intellectual rigor. Ginsberg also reveals how the legitimate grievances of minority groups and liberal activists, which were traditionally championed by faculty members, have, in the hands of administrators, been reduced to chess pieces in a game of power politics. By embracing initiatives such as affirmative action, the administration gained favor with these groups and legitimized a thinly cloaked gambit to bolster their power over the faculty. <br><br>As troubling as this trend has become, there are ways to reverse it. <em>The Fall of the Faculty </em>outlines how we can revamp the system so that real educators can regain their voice in curriculum policy.</p><p><br><strong>Benjamin Ginsberg</strong> is the David Bernstein Professor of Political Science, Director of the Center for the Study of American Government, and Chair of the Center for Advanced Governmental Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

It recognizes the large increase in government and other demands on the bureaucracy. But it dwells on the manifest fact--too often slighted--that administrators have their own fish to fry.

Ginsberg demonstrates why and how we're losing--or have already lost."--Theodore J. Lowi, Professor of American Institutions, Cornell University<p></p><br>"Ben Ginsberg knows a thing or two about academic bureaucracy. He has had extensive experience with administrative impediments that come between his ideas and their realization. Instead of ranting, he has written <em>The Fall of the Faculty,</em> where he has employed his political insight to examine administrative bloat in higher education and to explain the many ways in which administrative authority has elbowed aside faculty governance in the running of today's colleges and universities. As a recovering deanlet and one-time acting dean, I know whereof he speaks."--Matthew A. Crenson, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University<p></p><br>"In his lacerating "The Fall of the Faculty," Mr. Ginsberg argues that universities have degenerated into poorly managed pseudo-corporations controlled by bureaucrats so far removed from research and teaching that they have barely any idea what these activities involve. He attacks virtually everyone from overpaid presidents and provosts down through development officers, communications specialists and human-resource staffers but he reserves his most bitter scorn for the midlevel "associate deans" and "assistant deans" who often have the most direct control over the faculty. Mr. Ginsberg refers to them as "deanlets," but at my institution they are often called "ass. deans." The Fall of the Faculty" reads like a cross between a grand-jury indictment and a call to arms. Yet as bracing and darkly pleasurable as this call is, it is hard to imagine professors joining the resistance with so few weapons at their disposal."--The Wall Street Journal<p></p><br></p><h2>The Combined New Persian-English and English-Persian Dictionary (English and Persian Edition)</h2><p>This book is a combination and rearrangement of the pocket English-Persian and Persian-English dictionaries plus an all-new Etymological Study and the pioneering Guide to Punctuation in Persian.</p><p>Text: Persian, English</p><h2>STEM Student Research Handbook</h2><p>This resource for high school science teachers outlines the various stages of large-scale science research, enabling you to coach your students through any assignment.

The authors systematically reviewed each of the chapters from the previous edition to expand, update, and reorganize the material to make it even more useful to the student new to audiology, and at the same time continues to be more comprehensive than one might find in other introductory texts on audiology. The authors retained the features that worked well in previous editions, including an easy to read format, key learning objectives, and synopses within each chapter with bulleted highlights for review. Chapters are now organized in a more traditional sequence beginning with information about the profession of audiology, followed by acoustics, anatomy/physiology, and an expanded coverage of clinical audiology. References and figures have been updated, including photos of new hearing instruments and amplification devices.</p><p> This edition has four new chapters: Chapter 10. Outer and Middle Ear Assessment; Chapter 11. Evoked Physiologic Responses; Chapter 15. Implantable Devices; and Chapter 16. Vestibular System. Another substantive change includes a revision to Chapter 14 on Hearing Aids to make it more appropriate for the undergraduate student or others who want an overview of this important part of audiology. This edition now comes with a PluralPlus companion website with PowerPoint lecture slides and selected figures for instructors as well as an additional chapter on the history of audiology and selected resource links for students.</p><p> <b>A COMPANION WORKBOOK IS AVAILABLE!</b> <i>Audiology Workbook, Third Edition</i> is also available is a separate workbook that is composed of an abundance of questions and activities designed as a means for undergraduate and graduate students to reinforce their knowledge of concepts and procedures covered in introductory hearing science and clinical audiology courses.

By Suzanne Melcher, TRS/CTRS</p><p></p><h2>Theorizing Race in the Americas: Douglass, Sarmiento, Du Bois, and Vasconcelos</h2><p>In 1845 two thinkers from the American hemisphere--the Argentinean statesman Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and the fugitive ex-slave, abolitionist leader, and orator from the United States, Frederick Douglass--both published their first works. Each would become the most famous and enduring texts in what were both prolific careers, and they ensured Sarmiento and Douglass' position as leading figures in the canon of Latin American and U.S. African-American political thought, respectively. But despite the fact that both deal directly with key political and philosophical questions in the Americas, Douglass and Sarmiento, like African-American and Latin American thought more generally, are never read alongside each other. This may be because their ideas about race differed dramatically. Sarmiento advocated the Europeanization of Latin America and espoused a virulent form of anti-indigenous racism, while Douglass opposed slavery and defended the full humanity of black persons. Still, as Juliet Hooker contends, looking at the two together allows one to chart a hemispheric intellectual geography of race that challenges political theory's preoccupation with and assumptions about East/West comparisons, and questions the use of comparison as a tool in the production of theory and philosophy.<br><br>By juxtaposing four prominent nineteenth and twentieth-century thinkers--Frederick Douglass, Domingo F. Sarmiento, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Jos� Vasconcelos--her book will be the first to bring African-American and Latin American political thought into conversation. Hooker stresses that Latin American and U.S. ideas about race were not developed in isolation, but grew out of transnational intellectual exchanges across the Americas. In so doing, she shows that nineteenth and twentieth-century U.S. and Latin American thinkers each looked to political models in the "other" America to advance racial projects in their own countries. Reading these four intellectuals hemispheric thinkers, Hooker foregrounds elements of their work that have been dismissed by dominant readings, and provides a crucial platform to bridge the canons of Latin American and African-American political thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Juliet Hooker</strong> is Professor of Political Science at Brown University. She is the author of <em>Race and the Politics of Solidarity</em>.<br><br>"Hooker has made a remarkable contribution to our understanding of the discourse on race in the Americas by bringing the works of four of the most important theorists of race and difference into conversation with each other for the first time. Hooker has given us a seminal analysis of key similarities and differences in the development of scientific racism and racial thought in the Western Hemisphere, from debates about slavery before the Civil War and the legalization of de jure segregation in the latter half of the nineteenth century, to the rise of eugenics in the twentieth century. This is an original contribution to scholarship, required reading for every student of the history of race and racism, redefining what should properly be understood as 'American Studies.'" <br>--Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University<p></p><br>"In this groundbreaking book, Juliet Hooker traces the simultaneous development of racial thought across the United States and Latin America. With theoretical precision, Hooker innovatively juxtaposes the ideas of Frederick Douglass and Domingo F. Sarmiento, and W.E.B. Du Bois and Jos� Vasconcelos. Her 'hemispheric' perspective allows us to read 'familiar' theorists in ways that yield new and important insights. This book is of utmost importance to not only the scholarship on African-American political thought, but the political thought of the Americas. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the theory and practice of race and politics in the Americas. <em>Theorizing Race in the Americas</em> should not be missed." <br>--Michael Dawson, The University of Chicago<p></p><br>APSA Ralph J.

But some people regularly cross religious boundaries. These &#x201c;spiritually fluid&#x201d; people celebrate complex religious bonds, and in the process they blur social categories, evoke prejudice, and complicate religious communities. Their presence sparks questions: How and why do people become spiritually fluid? Are they just confused or unable to commit? How do we make sense of them?<br><br><i>When One Religion Isn&#x2019;t Enough</i> explores the lives of spiritually fluid people, revealing that while some chose multiple religious belonging, many more inherit it. For many North Americans, the complicated legacies of colonialism are part of their family story, and they may consider themselves both Christian and Hindu, or Buddhist, or Yoruban, or one of the many other religions native to colonized lands.<br><br>For some Asian Americans, singular religious identity may seem an alien concept, as many East Asian nations freely mix Buddhist, Confucian, Taoist, and other traditions. Some African American Christians are consciously seeking to reconnect with ancestral spiritualities. And still other people are born into religiously mixed families. Jewish-Christian intermarriage led the way in the US, but religious diversity here is only increasing: almost four in ten Americans (39 percent) who have married since 2010 have a spouse who is in a different religious group.<br><br>Through in-depth conversations with spiritually fluid people, renowned scholar Duane Bidwell explores how people come to claim and be claimed by multiple religious traditions, how spiritually fluid people engage radically opposed truth claims, and what this growing population tells us about change within our communities.</p><p><b>Duane R. Bidwell, PhD</b>, is professor of practical theology, spiritual care, and counseling at Claremont School of Theology, Claremont, California. A clinical fellow of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, Duane has been a chaplain, pastor, counselor, and nonprofit director. Currently, he sits on the board of the Taos Institute and maintains a small clinical practice at the Clinebell Institute for Pastoral Counseling and Psychotherapy in Claremont. Both Buddhist and Christian, he lives in California with his wife, son, and dog.&#x201c;Will appeal to spiritual readers seeking an understanding and affirmation of the growing multireligious movement. Strongly recommended for libraries of all types.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, Starred Review<br><br>&#x201c;The book operates with great sensitivity and awareness, addressing the difference between spiritual fluidity and spiritual bypassing or cultural appropriation . . . inspiring reading for anyone interested in enlivened spirituality or seeking permission to embrace their complexities.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;This groundbreaking book is essential for anyone who wants to understand the contemporary religious landscape. Duane Bidwell&#x2019;s work will now become a touchstone for academics, clergy, therapists, journalists, and all of us who participate in more than one religion. Bidwell offers up richly detailed personal stories told with great sensitivity. In telling these stories, this book documents spiritual fluidity as transgressive yet also life-giving, and as important and surprisingly common rather than marginal and exceptional.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Susan Katz Miller, author of <i>Being Both</i><br><br>&#x201c;Amid the growing academic, and often dissonant, conversations about multiple religious belonging, Duane Bidwell offers a fresh and clarifying voice. He invites &#x2018;spiritually fluid people&#x2019; to speak for themselves. His analysis follows, and is subordinate to, a careful listening to them&#x2014;and it results in new insights into what multiple belonging feels like, how it happens, and the difference it can make in one&#x2019;s life. Highly recommended for both academics and seekers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Paul F. Knitter, author of <i>Without Buddha I Could Not Be a Christian</i><br><br>&#x201c;For all those who deeply long for an abundant life, and who know such thirst cannot be quenched by the constraints of religious monogamy, this book is a must-read. <i>When One Religion Isn&#x2019;t Enough</i> speaks not only to those who deeply consider the sociopolitical ramifications of religious openness but to those who feel that being religiously faithful and spiritually deep can mean being open to more than just one religion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Isabelle Noth, professor for spiritual care, psychology of religion, and religious education, University of Bern, Switzerland<br><br>&#x201c;In this sharply insightful and refreshingly readable work, Bidwell takes us on an absorbing journey into the rapidly expanding world of religious fluidity. Simultaneously, he provides support and guidance to those embarked on this journey, while illuminating the rich potentials. In these times of increasingly fluid identities, the implications are legion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kenneth J. Gergen, author of <i>Relational Being: Beyond Self and Community</i><br><br>&#x201c;Bidwell, who is himself Buddhist-Christian, weaves tenderly crafted narratives and exercises the disciplines of silence and attention, practices that both traditions recognize as holy, in order to listen carefully to those who live with multiple religious belonging. The result: you cannot dismiss what elicits respect and even reverence. He shows that spiritually fluid lives may not have the intellectual consistency required by certain elite theologians fixated on doctrinal consistency, but these are nonetheless deeply considered lives marked by profound faithfulness and integrity. This learned book is the product of decades of intimate living with and listening to the religiously multiple; no one interested in the subject can afford to ignore it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;John Thatamanil, author of <i>The Immanent Divine: God, Creation, and the Human Predicament</i><br><br>&#x201c;Exploring religious multiplicity through the prism of experience, Duane Bidwell breaks fresh ground in this landmark work. Deeply attentive to the interstitial spaces in which religious multiplicity is shaped, the rarity of this book lies in the intricate, intimate, and insightful manner in which Bidwell captures the interplay of the sacred, the social, the familial, and the cultural in the lives of those who embody religious multiplicity. Outstanding and indispensable, this is a book that all those interested in the study of religion cannot afford to bypass.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Rev.

My forehead was damp with sweat as the dream faded, but his scream enveloped me, imprinting itself on my memory.<br><br>Another vision, one of dozens I'd had since leaving the Underworld an eternity ago. This time, however, I wasn't watching Henry go about his life as ruler of the dead as he waited for me to return. I wasn't standing by helplessly as Ava gave Henry false updates about where in Africa we were supposedly searching for Rhea.<br><br>Finally Henry knew what had really happened, and in the minutes before dawn broke through the night, I clung to the hope that it wasn't too late.<br><br>"A nightmare, my dear?"<br><br>I shivered, and the candles scattered throughout my prison lit up. Cronus sat beside my bed, in the same chair he'd occupied every night since late December, when I'd woken up with a pounding headache and memories I wished were nightmares.<br><br>This wasn't a nightmare, though. Cronus was here, working side by side with the Queen of the Gods, who would stop at nothing to hurt me as much as she possibly could.<br><br>The baby stirred inside me, undoubtedly unhappy about its rude awakening. I didn't dare speculate over whether it was a boy or a girl. If Calliope had her way, I might never know, and that heartache was already more than I could take. I set a hand on my swollen belly, so big that the simplest movements were difficult now, and mentally tried to soothe it. "You didn't hear that?" I said hoarsely.<br><br>"My son? Of course," said Cronus, reaching for my stomach. I slapped his hand away, and he chuckled. "It seems the games are about to begin."<br><br>"What games?" I knew the answer before I'd asked the question, though. My dream, my vision&#x2014;it was the autumnal equinox, and finally Henry knew I was missing.<br><br>A sharp pain shot from my back to my abdomen, and I gasped. Cronus was at my side in an instant, exactly the way Henry would've been if he were here. I turned away.<br><br>"Calliope has decided it will happen today," he murmured, and his voice would have been comforting if it hadn't come from him.<br><br>"Decided what would happen today?" I struggled to stand and make it to the bathroom, but my legs gave out. Cronus's cool hands were there to steady me, but as soon as I was back on the bed, I jerked away from him.<br><br>"That your child would be born."<br><br>All the air left my lungs, and this time it had nothing to do with physical pain. He was bluffing. They were trying to scare me into labor before Henry rescued me, or&#x2014;or something.<br><br>But as I leaned back, my hand found a wet spot on the mattress, and my damp nightgown clung to the back of my thighs. My water had broken sometime in the night. It was really happening.<br><br>Nine months of waiting. Nine months of fear. Nine months of time being the only thing standing between Calliope and the baby I was carrying, and now it was over.<br><br>I wasn't ready to be a mother. Never in a million years had I imagined having kids before I turned thirty, let alone twenty. But Calliope hadn't given me a choice, and with each day that passed, the sick dread inside me grew thicker until it nearly choked me. Calliope would take the baby from me, and there was nothing I could do about it. In a matter of hours, I would lose my child&#x2014;Henry's child&#x2014;to someone who wanted nothing more than to see me suffer.<br><br>But now he knew. Now there was a chance, if only I could hold on a little longer until Henry came.<br><br>Cronus must have seen the look on my face, because he chuckled and fluffed a pillow for me. "Do not worry, my dear. Calliope cannot kill you unless I allow her, and I assure you I would never hurt you."<br><br>It wasn't me I was worried about. "You're not going to hurt me, but you're going to let Calliope do it," I spat. "You're going to let her take the baby the moment it's born, and I'm never going to see it again."<br><br>Cronus stared at me blankly. These were the moments I remembered that in spite of his human form, he was anything but. He didn't understand why I loved the baby so much. Or, when I'd given Calliope too much attitude and she'd hit me in the mouth, why I'd instinctively covered my belly. He didn't get how badly the thought of being separated from the baby hurt me before I'd even met him or her.<br><br>Then again, Cronus was also the monster who'd tried to destroy his own children, so I suspected empathy was too much to hope for.<br><br>"If you would like to keep the child, all you need to do is say the word," he said, as if it were that simple. Maybe to him it was. "I will ensure that Calliope does not get in the way. In return, all I ask is that you rule by my side."<br><br>It wasn't the first time he'd made that offer, and it wasn't the first time that, for a single moment, I entertained the possibility. As the baby's birth loomed, saying no grew more and more difficult.<br><br>Cronus had made no secret of the fact that he wanted me as his queen while he ruled over the entire world, destroying everyone who dared to get in his way. I had no idea why&#x2014;the small bit of compassion I'd shown him in the Underworld, maybe, or because I hadn't fought him in the first war&#x2014;but it didn't matter. I would be safe from the destruction, and so would the baby. Henry, however, would be the first person Cronus ripped apart, and the entire world would follow.<br><br>As much as I loved this baby, as much as I would have done anything to keep it safe, I couldn't stand by Cronus's side as he wiped out humanity. I couldn't do nothing as he killed every last person I loved, and if I agreed, he would keep me alive until the end of all things. I wouldn't have the choice to die like Persephone had, and I couldn't live with that guilt no matter how happy and safe my baby was.<br><br>But time was running out. The game had changed now that the council knew I was gone, and if I could keep Cronus guessing long enough not to hurt anyone, then maybe that would give the council a chance to find Rhea. So I lied.<br><br>"Promise not to kill anyone, and I'll think about it."<br><br>He grinned, showing off a full set of pearly teeth. Cronus had the smile of an airbrushed movie star, and it only made him more unnerving. "Is that so? Very well. Agree and I will leave humanity alone. My quarrels are not with them, and one must have subjects when one rules."<br><br>"I said <em>anyone,"</em> I countered. "Not just humanity. You can't kill the council either."<br><br>Cronus eyed me, and I held my breath, hoping against hope I was worth this to him. I had to buy the council more time. "Surely you understand why my children must be contained, but I would be willing to...consider it, depending on the nature of our relationship. On how much you are willing to give." He ran his fingers through my hair, and I suppressed a shudder. "You and I, together for all eternity. Imagine, my dear, the beauty we would create. And of course your child will know your love, and you will never have to say goodbye."<br><br>I closed my eyes and pictured the moment I finally got to hold him or her. The baby would have dark hair, I was sure of it, and light eyes like me and Henry. Pink cheeks, ten fingers, ten toes, and I would love it instantly. I already did.<br><br>"You would be a mother," he murmured, his voice like a siren's call. "Forever there to love it, to nurture it, to raise it in your image. And I would be a father."<br><br>The spell he had over me shattered, and my eyes flew open. "You are <em>not</em> this baby's father," I said as another wave of pain washed over me. This was too fast. Contractions were supposed to come on slow and last for hours&#x2014;my mother had been in labor for over a day when I was born.<br><br>Cronus leaned in until his lips were an inch from mine. I wrinkled my nose even though his breath smelled like a cool autumn breeze. "No, I am not. I am so much more."<br><br>The door burst open, and Calliope stormed inside. She had aged progressively over the past nine months until the angles on her face had become sharper, and she'd grown several inches to tower over me. As Cronus looked like Henry, with his long dark hair and gray eyes that crackled with lightning and fog, Calliope now looked like my mother. Like an older blond version of me. And I hated her even more for it.<br><br>"What's going on?" she said, and I managed a faint smirk. Apparently she'd overheard something she didn't like.<br><br>"Nothing for you to worry yourself about," said Cronus as he straightened, though his eyes didn't leave mine.<br><br>"Cronus was making me an interesting offer," I said, sounding braver than I felt. "Turns out he isn't going to feed me to the fish like you want."<br><br>Her lips twisted into a snarl, but before she could say a word, Ava hurried past her carrying a large basket full of blankets and other things I couldn't make out in the candlelight. "I'm sorry," she said, her face flushed.<br><br>"It's about time," snapped Calliope, and she focused on me again. "I'd be careful if I were you, Kate. I have a new toy, and I've been itching to try it out on you."<br><br>"What new toy?" I said through gritted teeth.<br><br>Calliope glided to the side of my bed. "Haven't I told you? Nicholas generously donated his time and expertise to forge a weapon that will let me kill a god. His timing couldn't be better."<br><br>My blood ran cold. Nicholas, Ava's husband, had been kidnapped on the winter solstice during battle. Up until now, no one had said a word to me about him.<br><br>"That's impossible," I blurted. Nothing but Cronus could kill an immortal.<br><br>"Is it?" said Calliope with a wicked smile. "Are you willing to bet your sweet little darling's life on that?"<br><br>My heart dropped. She was going to kill my baby? "Ava?" I said, my tongue heavy in my mouth.<br><br>Biting her lip, Ava set her basket down at the foot of the bed. "I'm sorry."<br><br>The room spun around me. This was just another game. Calliope was trying to scare me by using the people I loved most against me, and this time my supposed best friend was playing along.<br><br>What if it wasn't a game, though? Calliope had sworn she would take away the thing I loved the most, and at the time I thought she'd meant Henry and the rest of my family. But she'd meant the baby. She was about to get everything she wanted from me&#x2014;there was no reason for her to lie. And the way Ava couldn't so much as look at me...<br><br>My throat swelled until I could barely breathe. "Get out."<br><br>Ava blinked. "But someone needs to be with you&#x2014;"<br><br>"I'd rather have Calliope here than you, you traitorous bitch," I spat. "Get <em>out."</em><br><br>Her eyes watered, and to my satisfaction, she fled, leaving me alone with Cronus and Calliope. Ava deserved this. She'd known what this would mean, that Calliope had every intention of slaughtering my baby. And if Calliope really had forced Nicholas to forge a weapon&#x2014;if Ava had distracted the council for the past nine months to give him enough time&#x2014;<br><br>I didn't care how much danger Nicholas was in. He was Calliope's son, and no matter how terrible a person she was, I couldn't imagine her killing her own child. But she was going to kill my baby without a second thought, and Ava had known the entire time.<br><br>Even if our positions had been reversed, even if Henry was the one Calliope held hostage, I would have never, ever done this to Ava. I would have never betrayed her and allowed Calliope to kill her child.<br><br>"That wasn't very nice," said Calliope in a singsong voice, and my stomach churned. She couldn't kill the baby. I wouldn't let her.<br><br>"I need to pee," I said, pushing myself up.<br><br>Calliope made a vague gesture and busied herself with unpacking the basket. Cronus offered me his hand, but I brushed it off.<br><br>"I think I can make it to the bathroom on my own," I said.<br><br>Crossing the room hadn't been easy since August, and my body strained with each step I took, but I made it. My prison wasn't exactly plush, although it wasn't a concrete cell with a thin mattress and grungy toilet either. It was a simple bedroom with a bathroom attached, and it was several stories up, making a window escape impossible. I might've been immortal, but I didn't have a clue whether or not the baby was. And if Calliope really did have a weapon that could kill a god, it didn't matter anyway.<br><br>I'd tried to get away several times when I'd still been mobile enough to have a chance, but between Cronus, Calliope and Ava, someone had always been there to stop me. I'd made it as far as the beach once, but I couldn't swim and they knew it. The council may have intended this island to be Cronus's prison, but it was mine now, too.<br><br>Closing the door behind me, I eased down onto the edge of the bathtub and cradled my head in my hands. Frustration rose inside me, threatening to spill out in a great sob, but I swallowed it. I needed a moment, and crying would only make Calliope come in after me.<br><br>"Henry." I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to picture him. "Please. Help us."<br><br>At last I sank into my vision. After nearly a year in this hellhole, I'd learned how to control them, but I still struggled to make it far enough to see him. Three golden walls formed around me, and the fourth became a long pane of windows much like the room in Henry's palace. But instead of black rock, I saw endless blue sky through the glass, and sunlight poured in, illuminating everything.<br><br>"You did this." The sound of Henry's voice caught my attention, and I turned. He had Walter by the lapels, and his eyes burned with anger and power I'd never seen before.<br><br>"It had to be done," said Walter unsteadily. Even he looked afraid. "We need you, brother, and if this is what it takes to get you to see that&#x2014;"<br><br>Henry threw Walter against the wall so hard that it fractured, leaving a web of cracks behind. "I will see you pay for this if it is the last thing I do," he growled.<br><br>"Enough." My mother's voice rang out, and both brothers turned toward her. She looked pale, and she folded her hands in front of her the way she did when she was trying to keep herself under control. "We will rescue Kate. There is still time, and the more we waste&#x2014;"<br><br>"We cannot risk our efforts for the life of one," said Walter.<br><br>"Then I will," snarled Henry.<br><br>Walter shook his head. "It is far too dangerous for you to go alone."<br><br>"He won't be alone," said my mother. "And if you value your hold over the council&#x2014;"<br><br>The muscles in my back and belly contracted, and the pain pulled me from my vision. Back in the bathroom, I let out a soft sob. My mother was wrong&#x2014;we were out of time. The baby was coming no matter how hard I tried to wait. Calliope would kill it, and there was no one here to stop her. Whether or not anyone came, there was no way out of this.

In reality, ninja wore outfits that let them be as unobtrusive as possible. Most dressed like farmers, both because it worked well as camouflage in a nation of farmers, and because most of them really were farmers. <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <b>2.</b> In Japanese, the word &#x201c;ninja&#x201d; is written with the kanji characters meaning &#x201c;clandestine&#x201d; and &#x201c;person.&#x201d; <p></p> <p> </p> <b>3.</b> Body odor was a significant issue for ninja, as a strong scent could lead to one&#x2019;s hiding place. They generally avoided highly aromatic foods such as garlic, chives, or onions, and meat, and bathed fastidiously. <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> <b>4.</b> Ninja watched their weight carefully, as one might expect for people who spent inordinate amounts of time hanging from rafters or crouched beneath floorboards. The ideal weight was said to be no greater than a full sack of rice: 132 lbs. <p></p> <p></p> <b>5.</b> Mochizuki Chiyojo remains the only female ninja of whom anything is even vaguely known. She created a squad of female intelligence operatives known as &#x201c;walking maidens&#x201d; who criss-crossed the country in the guise of holy women, entertainers, and prostitutes, gathering information for their masters. <p></p> <p> </p> <b>6.</b> Although in popular culture ninja are often portrayed as wearing chainmail shirts or hoods, the weight and noise made these useless for the average ninja mission, which relied on stealth and avoiding the enemy. <p></p> <p></p> <b>7.</b> With his eye-patch, rakish good looks, top-notch sword skills--and the ability to stop a sword between the palms of his hands--it&#x2019;s no wonder that 17th-century ninja rival Yagyu Jubei has been the star of countless comic books, films, and historical dramas. A classic scene early in Akira Kurasawa&#x2019;s <i>Seven Samurai</i>, in which a talented swordsman is forced to kill a challenger who refuses to admit defeat, is supposedly based on a real-life incident from Jubei&#x2019;s travels. <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> <b>8.</b> Momochi Tanba, seemingly a middle-aged farmer, was actually an extremely powerful figure in the early 16th century, who personally trained and commanded a vast army of ninja. He was so dedicated to subterfuge, that he split his time among three separate residences, each one with its own wife and family. <p></p> <p> </p> <b>9.</b> Upon becoming Shogun in 1716, Tokugawa Yoshimune established Japan&#x2019;s first true, clandestine intelligence service: the Omwa-ban, aka &#x201c;the Gardeners.&#x201d; <p></p> <p></p> <b>10.</b> In 1853, four heavily armed American warships sailed unannounced into Urago Harbor, just south of modern-day Tokyo. Unknown to Commodore Matthew Perry, the fleet&#x2019;s commander, Sawamura Jinzaburo Yasusuke, often called the &#x201c;last ninja,&#x201d; secretly boarded one of the American ships to gather information about the mysterious foreigners. He returned with items he took from the ship: two loaves of bread, two cigarettes, two candles, and two pages of a document, written in Dutch and believed to be personal writings. <p></p><b>Hiroko Yoda</b> and <b>Matt Alt</b> are a couple who run a Tokyo-based translation company that specializes in producing the English versions of Japanese video games, comic books and literature.

Based on the authoritative research of family sociologist Linda J. Waite, journalist Maggie Gallagher, and a number of other scholars, this book&#x2019;s findings dramatically contradict the anti-marriage myths that have become the common sense of most Americans. Today a broad consensus holds that marriage is a bad deal for women, that divorce is better for children when parents are unhappy, and that marriage is essentially a private choice, not a public institution. Waite and Gallagher flatly contradict these assumptions, arguing instead that by a broad range of indices, marriage is actually better for you than being single or divorced&#x2013; physically, materially, and spiritually. They contend that married people live longer, have better health, earn more money, accumulate more wealth, feel more fulfillment in their lives, enjoy more satisfying sexual relationships, and have happier and more successful children than those who remain single, cohabit, or get divorced.<br><br><i>The Case for Marriage </i>combines clearheaded analysis, penetrating cultural criticism, and practical advice for strengthening the institution of marriage, and provides clear, essential guidelines for reestablishing marriage as the foundation for a healthy and happy society.<br><br>&#x201c;A compelling defense of a sacred union. <i>The Case for Marriage </i>is well written and well argued, empirically rigorous and learned, practical and commonsensical.&#x201d; -- William J. Bennett, author of <i>The Book of Virtues<br><br></i>&#x201c;Makes the absolutely critical point that marriage has been misrepresented and misunderstood.&#x201d; -- <i>The Wall Street Journal<br></i><br>www.broadwaybooks.com</p><p>The wages of the married are high, commitment is good for the libido, and, despite 30 years of arguments to the contrary, happiness may just depend on reciting the wedding vow, according to Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher. After sifting through the evidence and conducting their own studies, the authors conclude that marriage is beneficial and transformational, and that neither cohabitation nor swinging singledom are all they're cracked up to be. In fact, it turns out that marriage is a public heath issue: being single can take almost 10 years off a man's life, while wifely nagging really is good for his health. Getting and keeping a wife can also increase a man's income as much as an education. Waite and Gallagher debunk a number of myths about marriage, including the one that says men get a better deal. Acknowledging that there may have been some truth to this in the past, better equity in modern marriages means that women make out just as well as men, though in different ways. Divorce--not marriage--is especially bad for women's health; parenting young children--not marriage--is the usual source of depression seen in mothers; and battering is significantly more common in cohabitating couples. <p> So, what does threaten marriage? For one, the insecurity engendered by the cultural acceptance of divorce. Couples are now less willing to invest fully in each other, the authors write, while "commitment produces contentment; uncertainty creates agony." Cultural indifference towards marriage is the other big downer. Because marriage is a public commitment, it can "work its miracles only if it is supported by the whole society." Not surprisingly, divorce gets a very bad rap as Waite and Gallagher pull out the heavyweight facts, particularly when it comes to its effect on children. The good news, though, is that marriage is resilient--five years down the road most couples who considered but resisted divorce found that they were happy again. Since Americans are still the marrying kind despite the cynicism, fear, and laissez-faire attitudes, <i>The Case for Marriage</i> makes a reassuring and compelling case for keeping on keeping on. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Advance Praise for <b>The Case for Marriage</b>:<br><br>"In this book Maggie Gallagher and Linda Waite make a compelling defense of a sacred union. <b>The Case for Marriage</b> is well written and well argued, empirically rigorous and learned, practical and commonsensical.

Seen for decades in tech circles as a fast follower rather than an innovation leader, Samsung today has grown to became a market leader in the U.S. and around the globe. They have captured one quarter of the smart phone market and have been pushing the envelope on every front. <br><br>Forty years ago, Samsung was a rickety Korean agricultural conglomerate that produced sugar, paper, and fertilizer, located in a backward country with a third-world economy. But with the rise of the PC revolution, Chairman Lee Byung-chul began a bold experiment: to make Samsung a major supplier of computer chips. The multimillion-dollar plan was incredibly risky. But Lee, wowed by a young Steve Jobs, who sat down with the chairman to offer his advice, became obsessed with creating a tech empire. And in <i>Samsung Rising</i>, we follow Samsung behind the scenes as the company fought its way to the top of tech. It is one of Apple's chief suppliers of technology critical to the iPhone, and its own Galaxy phone outsells the iPhone. <br><br>Today, Samsung employs 369,000 people (compared to Apple's 80,000, and Google's 48,000). The company's revenues have grown more than forty times from that of 1987, and make up more than twenty percent of South Korea's exports. Yet their disastrous recall of the Galaxy Note 7, with numerous reports of phones spontaneously bursting into flames, reveals the dangers of the company's headlong attempt to overtake Apple at any cost. <br><br>A sweeping, insider account of the Korean company's ongoing war against the likes of Google and Apple,<i> Samsung Rising</i> shows how a determined and fearless Asian competitor has become a force to be reckoned with.</p><p><b>Geoffrey Cain</b> has spent more than ten years covering Samsung, South Korea, and technology for <i>The Economist</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Time</i>, and other publications.</p><h2>Samuel Pepys The Diaries</h2><p>When Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) began writing in 1660 he was a young clerk living in London, struggling to pay his rent. Over the next nine years as he kept his journal, he rose to be a powerful naval administrator. He became eyewitness to some of the most significant events in seventeenth-century English history, among them, the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 (he was in the ship that brought back Charles II from exile), the plague that ravaged the capital in 1665, and the Great Fire of 1666, described with poetry and horror. Pepys&#39;s diary gives vivid descriptions of spectacular events, but much of the richness of the diary lies in the details it provides about the minor dramas of daily life. While Pepys was keen to hear the King&#39;s views, he was also ready to talk with a soldier, a housekeeper, or a child rag-picker. He records with searing frankness his tumultuous personal and professional life: the pleasures and frustrations of his marriage, together with his infidelities, his ambitions, and his power schemes. All of this was set down in shorthand, to protect it from prying eyes. The result is a lively, often astonishing, diary and an unrivalled account of life in seventeenth-century London.</p><p>Samuel Pepys (Author) Samuel Pepys was born on 23 February 1633, the son of a London tailor. He graduated from Cambridge in 1654, and in 1655 he married Elizabeth St Michel. He started work for Sir Edward Montague, a relation who later became the 1st Earl of Sandwich, and through him first went to sea. Pepys later found work with the Navy Office, eventually rising to become Secretary of the Admiralty. He also became a JP, an MP and a Fellow of the Royal Society. In later life he was accused of being part of the anti-monarchist `Popish Plot&#39;, and was twice imprisoned for it. Upon his second release he retired to Clapham, then considered to be `in the country&#39;. Samuel Pepys died on 26 May 1703. His diaries, which had been written in code, were bequeathed to Magdalen College, Cambridge, where they can still be viewed.</p><h2>Archery Fundamentals (Sports Fundamentals)</h2><p><p> Archery is one of the hottest sports out there, and there's no better introduction to the sport than <i>Archery Fundamentals, Second Edition</i>. </p><p> Inside are all of the essentials you need to succeed and get on target.

Radicalism is as American as apple pie. One can scarcely imagine what American society would look like without the abolitionists, feminists, socialists, union organizers, civil-rights workers, gay and lesbian activists, and environmentalists who have fought stubbornly to breathe life into the promises of freedom and equality that lie at the heart of American democracy. The first anthology of its kind, <i>The Radical Reader</i> brings together more than 200 primary documents in a comprehensive collection of the writings of America's native radical tradition. Spanning the time from the colonial period to the twenty-first century, the documents have been drawn from a wealth of sourcesspeeches, manifestos, newspaper editorials, literature, pamphlets, and private letters. From Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" to Kate Millett's "Sexual Politics," these are the documents that sparked, guided, and distilled the most influential movements in American history. Brief introductory essays by the editors provide a rich biographical and historical context for each selection included. Includes: <br> <i>Common Sense</i>, Thomas Paine <br> <i>Second Inaugural Address</i>, Abraham Lincoln <br> <i>Confession</i>, Nat Turner <br> <i>Last Speech to the Jury</i>, John Brown <br> <i>Letters on the Equality of the Sexes</i>, Sarah Grimke <br> <i>Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions</i>, Seneca Falls Convention <br> <i>Life in the Iron Mills</i>, Rebecca Harding Davis <br> <i>Speech to Striking Coal Miners</i>, Mother Jones <br> <i>Letter from Birmingham Jail</i>, Martin Luther King, Jr. <br> <i>The Ballot or the Bullet</i>, Malcolm X <br> <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>, Betty Friedan <br> <i>Silent Spring</i>, Rachel Carson</p><p><b>Timothy Patrick McCarthy</b> teaches history and literature at Harvard University, where he has won several teaching awards. He is co-editor, with John Stauffer, of <i>Millennial Vistas: Reconsiderations of American Abolitionism</i>, forthcoming from The New Press. <b>John McMillian</b> teaches history and literature at Harvard University. His articles and review essays have appeared in <i>Radical History Review; Rethinking History; American Quarterly</i>; and elsewhere. He is co-editor, with Paul Buhle, of <i>The New Left Re-examined</i> (Temple University Press).Progressive radicalism, the array of traditions that "seeks to expand existing definitions of freedom, equality, justice, and opportunity," is intrinsic to American society and essential to democracy. From the revolution that gave birth to our nation to abolitionism, the labor movement, suffrage and feminism, civil rights, gay liberation, and environmentalism, radicalism has been responsible for maintaining the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution, and for ensuring that quality of life and justice aren't forfeited in the pursuit of wealth and power. Two Harvard-based historians explicate and encapsulate the rich and vital spectrum of American radicalism by presenting more than 200 declarations, appeals, editorials, and essays by such radical thinkers (each introduced in a brief bio) as Frederick Douglass, Sarah Grimke, Henry David Thoreau, Upton Sinclair, Emma Goldman, Angela Davis, Betty Friedan, Mario Savio, Cesar Chavez, Rachel Carson, Tony Kushner, and Ralph Nader. The result is proof-positive that the U.S. has always been "a protest nation," a society of necessary sacrifice and tremendous achievement, and every citizen should hope that it remains so. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The 21 numbered playing cards of tarot have always exerted strong fascination, way beyond their original purpose, and the multiple resonances of the deck are ubiquitous. From T S Eliot and his 'wicked pack of cards' in "The Waste Land" to the psychic divination of Solitaire in Ian Fleming's "Live and Let Die"; and from the satanic novels of Dennis Wheatley to the deck's adoption by New Age practitioners, the cards have in modern times become inseparably connected to the occult. They are now viewed as arguably the foremost medium of prophesying and foretelling. Yet, as the author shows, originally the tarot were used as recreational playing cards by the Italian nobility in the Renaissance. It was only much later, in the 18th and 19th centuries, that the deck became associated with esotericism before evolving finally into a diagnostic tool for mind, body and spirit.<br>This is the first book to explore the remarkably varied ways in which tarot has influenced culture. Tracing the changing patterns of the deck's use, from game to mysterious oracular device, Helen Farley examines tarot's emergence in 15th century Milan and discusses its later associations with astrology, kabbalah and the Age of Aquarius.</p></p><p>Helen Farley is Lecturer in Studies in Religion and Esotericism at the University of Queensland. She is editor of the international journal Kthonios: A Journal for the Study of Religion and has written widely on a variety of topics and subjects, including ritual, divination, esotericism and magic.'Deeply researched and elegantly written, Farley's is by far the most important contemporary contribution to the academic study of the Tarot. No serious work in the history of Western Esotericism will be able to ignore the author's ground-breaking study. Engrossing and fascinating' (Philip C Almond, University of Queensland)<br><br>'Helen Farley takes the reader deep into the diverse worlds of late Renaissance Italy, Enlightenment France, Victorian England and New Age America - and a host of other milieux - in her impressive study of tarot symbolism. She offers a comprehensive yet detailed study of the changing imagery in the cards as they emerged from their evolving historical contexts. Rarely does a book offer such a wealth of information over such a broad span of time in a way that does justice to its subject: but Farley accomplishes her task with thoroughness and diligence. A Cultural History of Tarot makes a welcome and valuable contribution to the body of recent scholarship on the history of esotericism. More than that, it provides a roadmap to show how scholars of art and culture can engage meaningfully with the fascinating esoteric strands of Europe's past.'

Time and time again he beat insurmountable odds (often, it seems, without realizing they existed) and came out on top (and flush with cash). A farm laborer, with little schooling to speak of, Dexter catapulted himself into the &#39;Who&#39;s Who&#39; of 18th Century New England society through numerous trading endeavors of all sorts. But for all of his quirks, he also seems to have been something of a cruel prankster. Many of the events of his later life would make most men of honor blush with shame. Doubly so when one reviews the treatment his wife endured. This work was originally published as an exercise in vanity. It became inexplicably popular, however, after Dexter freely handed out the first printing. In the second, he addressed the criticisms of &#39;lack of punctuation&#39; by ending the work with an entire page devoted solely to it, which he suggested the reader insert anywhere they like within the work. The strange book went on to be formally reprinted eight times. This book is - and has remained - one of the oddest, most bizarre publications ever brought to public light. It&#39;s difficult to enjoy yet, strangely, it is equally difficult to dismiss.</p><p></p><h2>Pathways: A Guided Workbook for Youth Beginning Treatment</h2><p>The Pathways workbook has been a cornerstone in the treatment of sexually aggressive youth since the first edition was issued twenty years ago.

Moltmann rejects the traditional approach, which focuses on the End, an apocalyptic finale, as a kind of Christian search for the &#34;final solution.&#34; He centers instead on hope and God&#39;s promise of new creation for all things. &#34;Christian eschatology,&#34; he says, &#34;is the remembered hope of the raising of the crucified Christ, so it talks about beginning afresh in the deadly end.&#34; Yet Moltmann&#39;s novel framework, deeply informed by Jewish and messianic thought, also fosters rich and creative insights into the perennially nettling questions of eschatology: Are there eternal life and personal identity after death? How is one to think of heaven, hell, and purgatory? What are the historical and cosmological dimensions of Christian hope? What are its social and political implications. In a heartbreakingly fragile and fragment world, Moltmann&#39;s comprehensive eschatology surveys the Christian vista, bravely envisioning our &#34;horizons of expectation&#34; for personal, social, even cosmic transformation in God.</p><p>Jurgen Moltmann is Professor Emeritus of Theology at the University of Tubingen in Germany, and one of the most prominent and revered scholars in contemporary Christian theology.

In college, she studied diet therapies as treatment for illness and has taught cooking and nutrition courses at Columbia University. Centeno has cooked in esteemed New York City restaurants such as EAT Greenpoint and Fatty Cue. She lives in Brooklyn, NY, with her two sons.A cleanse? Really? That's the answer? The last thing a driven, productive person needs is a complicated diet that creates more work and causes anxiety. Often, the simplest answer is the right one, and that's the case with the Soup Cleanse. Unlike other so-called cleanses, my Soup Cleanse isn't a quick fix. It's a regular routine that combines a higher-intensity reset along with my simple meal swaps to maintain great health while allowing lots of flexibility to (gasp!) eat things other than soup. The Soup Cleanse is based on the principle that small changes made every day produce big results.<br><br>It's true: Our bodies have wonderful natural cleansing mechanisms. The liver removes toxins from our blood, and the kidneys further filter that blood and make sure those toxins are excreted properly. When I talk about a soup cleanse, I mean this to be an opportunity to help your organs do the good job they already do; to provide your cells with exclusively plant- based fuel; and to increase your absorption of antioxidants, which help combat diseases and improve the function of your circulatory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. There is loads of research that shows just how much better our bodies run when we give them more plant- based nutrients.<br><br>Eating more plants and eating primarily because you're hungry (also known as portion control) are key components of any healthy lifestyle. But we often fail at this because of our environment; temptations, triggers, and old habits throw us off course and keep us in a frustrating cycle of knowing what we want but not sticking to an action plan. Creating new patterns that are healthier than current patterns is the key, but change is tough. We create new patterns and stick to them when we receive a reward (the quicker we receive the reward, the better) and when the new patterns are actually simpler than the old ones (like texting with a friend instead of using voice calls and voicemail). This is the essence of the Soup Cleanse. I wanted to create new patterns that made me feel so good that I would stick with them forever. When we get a reward from a simpler pattern, then everything makes sense. I call this practicality.<br><br>Soup is the perfect food for creating new patterns because many of us have positive emotional connections to soup--a loved one serving us a bowl after playing in the snow all day, cozying up to a big bowl on a sick day, making a pot of chili with friends for a tailgate party. Soup unifies, soup heals, and soup makes us feel good. It's also perfect for all sorts of science-y reasons. Soup keeps you satisfied with a lower caloric density, and because it is usually cooked, the digestive process starts before you have your first spoonful, meaning your body can absorb and use the nutrients more readily. These were the main reasons I started cooking soup.<br><br>Before I launched Splendid Spoon, I had another soup company: Sea Bean Goods. This was a pop-up and catering project I embarked on while I continued to work full-time in advertising at Cond� Nast. For 21/2 years I souped on the side to test my chops as a professional cook and entrepreneur. Around 4 a.m. I would splash cold water on my face, hop on my bike, and ride to a pizza kitchen on Greenpoint Avenue in Brooklyn. If you had one of my soups from 2011 to 2012, there is a good chance it was made in a small pot next to a screaming-hot brick pizza oven. Working next to that oven before an 8-hour day at the office tested my mettle, but my physical fatigue inspired some of Splendid Spoon's bestselling flavors. Soup became my solace, my energy, and my fortitude. Above all, it became my go-to meal when I was dog-tired at various points during those 15-hour days. I'd sip soup on ice in the morning, pour it into thermoses for a hot lunch, and savor a bowl for dinner. I'd always share with my colleagues and friends. There were many days when all I ate was soup.<br><br>Eating soup simplified my life in this way. Truthfully, I would have been eating croissants all day if I had been a croissant maker. But (thankfully) there was a healthful reward with eating soup that kept me going back for more. Actually, there were three rewards: (1) It was convenient to eat any time, hot or cold. (2) It was satisfying for several hours. (3) I had more energy and was even opting for more vegetable-centric food when I cooked nonsoup meals. These were all positive things, but I knew that in order for eating soup to really become a lasting pattern, I would need to up the ante in the rewards department.<br><br>Meditation and mindfulness have been a positive part of my life since I first studied Buddhism as a young child. I remember staring intently at a sculpture of the Buddha at RISD (Rhode Island School of Design). His expression was placid, content. He was so comforting to look at that I found myself gazing at him long after the group had moved on. I continued my own research into meditation (or mindfulness, as it's often referred to in Buddhism and as I'll refer to it in this book) and its effects on the body and mind. Was this really the key to peace and happiness? Maybe. But more importantly for souping, there's an immediate reward with mindfulness.<br><br>Taking your time when you eat is a form of mindfulness. Your mind is nudged into a connection with your body's actions because you eat soup more slowly than you eat a sandwich, drink a smoothie, or twirl up forkfuls of pasta. Yes, you can slow down your eating of any food or beverage, but soup really helps you slow down because it's often warm (pause, blow, sip tentatively) and because it's liquid (fill the spoon, not too much, that's just right, now lift carefully lest you dribble that broth down your chin). When we take a few extra minutes to connect our minds to our bodies through mindfulness, we create positive new connections in our brains. We stimulate endorphins. We settle the mind and unlock its reward center. Practicing mindfulness regularly and over time is proven to have really profound effects on our health and happiness, and many of us gain a sense of calm and clarity even after only 5 to 10 minutes of mindful exercise.<br><br>My weekly souping plan wraps four very powerful elements together: plant- based nutrition, practicality, portion control (intermittent fasting), and mindfulness. I call these the four pillars, and they support the foundation for a better me, a better you, a more Splendid Self. (I describe these in more detail below.) The idea is that the soup does a lot of the heavy lifting for you by pulling these four elements together. All you have to do is invite those soup rituals into your weekly routine.<br><br>Still unsure of this whole doctor-approved thing? You will be hard-pressed to find a physician who does not agree with my philosophy: Eat more vegetables, practice portion control, and embrace small changes that can become long-lasting habits. These behaviors are paramount to creating a healthier relationship with food. There are no quick fixes, but sometimes the most nourishing, simple solutions can truly enhance your life. That's how souping works. It's not a quick fix, but it is simple, and it will enhance your life. Bring this book to your next doctor's visit, and ask her if she agrees.<br><br>Arts and Sciences<br><br>My grandfather was a surgeon, his sister was a pediatric specialist, my aunt is an allergist, and my uncle is also a practicing physician. Growing up with doctors in my family meant looking at the human body as a set of intricate systems--so if you're sick, it means one of those systems needs fixing. I have always respected the scientific process for explaining how things work and for offering solutions to what ails us. But while my dad's side of the family was governed by the rules of Western medicine, my mom's side of the family embraced the power of Mother Nature to alleviate and prevent ailments. To this day, when I have a cold, my dad will offer a decongestant and my mom will make me a scalding hot tea of echinacea, goldenrod, and licorice and prescribe a day of rest.<br><br>My mom--while respectful of the need for traditional medicine in extreme circumstances--believes that 99 percent of our ailments are not extreme. She taught me that most of what ails us can be alleviated or prevented by eating more vegetables, moving more, and laughing a lot. Get fresh air every day. Embrace the people you love. Dive into the ocean whenever possible. And the various things that push our limits of patience and tolerance every day--don't analyze them so much. The saying "Don't sweat the small stuff" was uttered frequently in my childhood home. Stress less and let go more. I always loved the positive reinforcement of my mom's approach to health. It felt more like an art than a science to place faith in my body and trust its ability to strengthen and support me. However, I am my father's daughter, and I enjoy the confidence of knowing my wellness choices are backed by science.<br><br>The point is, science is important, but it's not all or nothing. We are fortunate to live during a time when people can dedicate their lives to scientific research that helps us understand how to live longer, happier lives. Practically speaking, though, most of us don't want to agonize over the relative health benefits of broccoli versus spinach. It's not a comfortable existence to require scientific proof for every choice you make, especially when you're hungry for dinner.<br><br>It's great, for example, to plan out a week of healthy, plant-based meals but counterproductive to get stressed when a good friend throws a last- minute birthday party smack in the middle of your week. Instead of thinking about the party as a collision with your best-laid plans, maybe embrace the fact that socializing with your buddies will have a positive impact on your well-being, too--and have a bowl of soup before the party so you go for a smaller slice of cake. Life is full of surprises and gray areas and unpredictability, so why should our approach to health be all or nothing? Stressing about the last-minute changes to your daily life will only serve to erode your feelings of confidence. Souping is about acknowledging that we do the best we can to make healthy choices, that our bodies benefit from all sorts of small changes, and that having confidence in ourselves is absolutely the best feeling of all.<br><br>I created the Soup Cleanse so I didn't have to agonize about my food choices. Everyone talks about balance, but it feels a lot more like juggling. Before we can balance all the meaningful elements that make up a life, it's important to strengthen what's inside us first. Think of it like this: You don't go into a full headstand when you walk into a yoga class; first you find your center through breathing and core-strengthening poses to support the more challenging ones. I created the weekly Soup Cleanse Plan out of an unavoidable need to center myself. It started with a big dose of self-love so I could build from the inside out.<br><br>This all may sound like common sense, but it really took some time for me to fully grasp just how important it was to prioritize my own health. I had been selling soup and working on recipes for over a year as a side gig to my full-time job in media strategy at Cond� Nast, but it wasn't until I became pregnant that Splendid Spoon launched as a plant-based wellness brand, and it wasn't until the great asparagus fiasco of 2013 that the 7- day plan was born as a remedy to my demanding life.<br><br>This book is the culmination of many fits and starts and failed attempts, spilled soup, spoiled soup, exploding soup, and botched flavors. I've simplified and distilled all my lessons into an incredibly easy plan that anyone can follow and anyone with any dietary preferences can adapt for improved health. The plan is driven by my (and now Splendid Spoon's) four- pillar philosophy: plant-based nutrition, practicality, portion control (intermittent fasting), and mindfulness. Soup helps me be the best I can be because it is rooted in a foundation that supports me rather than asking me to do more. Here is the story of how these pillars came to be.<br><br>Grown Woman Seeking Plant-Based Nutrition:<br><br>My Less-Than-Splendid Former Self<br><br>The average American's diet is 28 percent animal products, 41 percent fatty and sugary "extras," 23 percent grains, and only 8 percent fruits and vegetables.1, 2 Sixty-nine percent of us are overweight.3 And the leading causes of death are heart disease, cancer, and lower respiratory diseases.4 There is no doubt that eating a diet rich in vegetables improves health in a multitude of ways, from decreasing the likelihood of type 2 diabetes and many cancers to improving life span and literally every system in our bodies.5 Yet, 87 percent of Americans don't eat enough vegetables.6 This is not right. Something is awry. What's wrong here?<br><br>Avoiding vegetables is, unfortunately, the path of least resistance. This reality really bugs me because I know (and so do you) how great vegetables are for health. The uphill battle to get more veggies into our diets is due in no small part to what's available at restaurants and as packaged convenience food. It's also due to the fact that rich, sugary, starchy, salty food sets off all sorts of pleasure signals in our brains, and it creates a bit of an addiction to those things.<br><br>My own diet was evidence of this and hit its apex while I was in school at The French Culinary Institute in Manhattan in 2010. I consumed an excessive amount of meat. And potatoes had "somehow" become my go-to vegetable of choice--thanks, culinary school, for the 101 ways to mash, fry, and saut� spuds. I went through about a �d of butter a week because it had crept into literally every recipe I concocted. I frequently managed to subvert the amazing health benefits of spinach, for example, by smothering it in roux and drowning it in cream and cheese. I was driven by taste and only taste.</p><h2>Gesundheit!: Bringing Good Health to You, the Medical System, and Society through Physician Service, Complementary Therapies, Humor, and Joy</h2><p>The inspiring and hilarious story of Patch Adams's quest to bring free health care to the world and to transform the way doctors practice medicine <br> <br>� Tells the story of Patch Adam's lifetime quest to transform the health care system <br> <br>� Released as a film from Universal Pictures, starring Robin Williams <br> <br>Meet Patch Adams, M.D., a social revolutionary who has devoted his career to giving away health care.

I mean, I don&#x2019;t think I can&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Dani, you&#x2019;re all we&#x2019;ve got. You&#x2019;re all they&#x2019;ve got.

Down into hell. <br><br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t on the blueprints.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Bad place to get trapped in a burning building,&#x201d; Hollis noted. &#x201c;The roof could fall in on us. Easily.&#x201d; <br><br>Bishop appeared out of the smoke as suddenly as Hollis had, weapon in hand, his face stone, eyes haunted. &#x201c;We have to hurry.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Hollis replied, &#x201c;we get that. Burning building. Maniacal killer. Good seriously outnumbered by evil. Bad situation.&#x201d; Her words and tone were flippant, but her gaze on his face was anything but, intent and measuring. <br><br>&#x201c;You forgot potential victim in maniacal killer&#x2019;s hands,&#x201d; her boss said, not even trying to match her tone. <br><br>&#x201c;Never. Dani, did you see the basement, or are you feeling it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Stairs. I saw them.&#x201d; The weight on her shoulders felt like the world, so maybe that was what was pressing her down. Or . . . &#x201c;And what I feel now ...He&#x2019;s lower. He&#x2019;s underneath us.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then we look for stairs.&#x201d; <br><br>Dani coughed. She was trying to think, trying to remember. But dreams recalled were such dim, insubstantial things, even vision dreams sometimes, and there was no way for her to be sure she was remembering clearly. She was overwhelmingly conscious of precious time passing and looked at her wrist, at the bulky digital watch that told her it was 2:47 p.m. on Tuesday, October 28. <br><br>Odd. She never wore a watch. Why was she wearing one now? And why a watch that looked so . . . alien on her thin wrist? <br><br>&#x201c;Dani?&#x201d; <br><br>She shook off the momentary confusion. &#x201c;The stairs. Not where you&#x2019;d expect them to be,&#x201d; she managed finally, coughing again. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in a closet or something like that. A small office. Room. Not a hallway. Hallways&#x2013;&#x201d; A flash of endless, featureless hallways, brightly lit . . . <br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br><br>The image in her mind vanished as quickly as it had come, and Dani dismissed it as unimportant because an absolute certainty had replaced it. &#x201c;Shit. The basement is divided. By a solid wall. Two big rooms. And accessed from this main level by two different stairways, one at each side of the building, in the back.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What kind of crazy-ass design is that?&#x201d; Hollis demanded. <br><br>&#x201c;If we get out of this alive, you can ask the architect.&#x201d; The smell of blood was almost overpowering, and Dani&#x2019;s head was beginning to hurt. Badly. Hallways. No, not hallways, two separate spaces, distinct sides . . . She had never before pushed herself for so long without a break, especially with this level of intensity.<br> <br>It was Bishop who said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know which side they&#x2019;re in.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; She felt as if she&#x2019;d been apologizing to this man since she met him. Hell, she had been. <br><br>Hollis was scowling. To Bishop, she said, &#x201c;Great. That&#x2019;s just great. You&#x2019;re psychically blind, the storm has all my senses scrambled, and we&#x2019;re in a huge burning building without a freakin&#x2019; map.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Which is why Dani is here.&#x201d; Those pale sentry eyes were fixed on her face. <br>Dani felt wholly inadequate. &#x201c;I&#x2013;I don&#x2019;t&#x2013; All I know is that he&#x2019;s down there somewhere.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And Miranda?&#x201d; <br><br>The name caused her a queer little shock, and for no more than a heartbeat, Dani had the dizzy sense of something out of place, out of sync somehow. But she had an answer for him. Of sorts. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t&#x2013;dead. Yet. She&#x2019;s bait, you know that. She was always bait, to lure you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And you,&#x201d; Bishop said. <br><br>Dani didn&#x2019;t want to think about that. Couldn&#x2019;t, for some reason she was unable to explain, think about that. &#x201c;We have to go, now. He won&#x2019;t wait, not this time.&#x201d; And he&#x2019;s not the only one. <br><br>The conversation had taken only brief minutes, but even so the smoke was thicker, the crackling roar of the fire louder, and the heat growing ever more intense. <br><br>Bitterly, Hollis said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on his timetable, just like before, like always, carried along without the chance to stop and think.&#x201d; <br><br>Bishop turned and started toward the rear of the building and the south corner. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go down on this side. You two head for the east corner.&#x201d; <br><br>Dani wondered if instinct was guiding him as well, but all she said, to Hollis, was, &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t take the chance if he had it, would he? To stop and think, I mean.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If it meant a minute lost in getting to Miranda? No way in hell. That alone would be enough, but on top of that he blames himself for this mess.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t have known&#x2013;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He could have. Maybe he even did. That&#x2019;s why he believes it&#x2019;s his fault. Come on, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d; <br><br>Dani followed but had to ask, &#x201c;Do you believe it&#x2019;s his fault?&#x201d; <br><br>Hollis paused for only an instant, looking back over her shoulder, and there was something hard and bright in her eyes. &#x201c;Yes. I do. He played God one time too many. And we&#x2019;re paying the price for his arrogance.&#x201d; <br><br>Again, Dani followed the other woman, her throat tighter despite the fact that, as they reached the rear half of the building, the smoke wasn&#x2019;t nearly as thick. They very quickly discovered, in the back of what might once have been a small office, a door that opened smoothly and silently to reveal a stairwell. <br><br>The stairwell was already lighted. <br><br>&#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; Hollis breathed. <br><br>A part of Dani wanted to suggest that they wait, at least long enough for Bishop to check out the other side of the building, but every instinct as well as the waves of heat at her back told her there simply wasn&#x2019;t time to wait. <br>Hollis shifted her weapon to a steady two-handed grip and sent Dani a quick look. &#x201c;Ready?&#x201d; <br><br>Dani didn&#x2019;t spare the energy to wonder how anyone on earth could ever be ready for this. Instead, she concentrated on the only weapon she had, the one inside her aching head, and nodded. <br><br>Hollis had only taken one step when a thunderous crash sounded behind them and a new wave of almost intolerable heat threatened to shove them bodily into the stairwell. <br><br>The roof was falling in.</p><h2>Terrific</h2><p><b>Grouchy Eugene knew this trip to Bermuda was a bad idea&#x2014;now he's stranded on a desert island!

Reserved and honorable, Malik wouldn't be noticed by a bystander in a Nairobi street&#x2014;except perhaps to comment on his carefully sculpted combover. But beneath that unprepossessing exterior lies a warm heart and a secret passion.<br><br>But just as Malik is getting up the nerve to invite Rose to the Nairobi Hunt Club Ball (the premier social occasion of the Kenyan calendar), who should pop up but his nemesis from his school days. The jokester Harry Khan, good-looking in a flashy way and quick of foot, has also become enraptured with the object of Malik&#x2019;s affection.<br> So begins the competition cooked up by fellow members of the Asadi club: whoever can identify the most species of birds in one week&#x2019;s time gets the privilege of asking Ms. Mbikwa to the ball.<br> Set against the lush Kenyan landscape rich with wildlife and political intrigue, this irresistible novel has been sold in eight countries and is winning fans worldwide.</p><p>NICHOLAS DRAYSON has written extensively about wildlife and natural history; he is also the author of Confessing a Murder, which was hailed by Booklist for its &#x201c;view of Darwin never before seen.&#x201d; An Englishman by birth, Drayson lived in Nairobi for two years.Chapter 1<br><br> Ah yes,&#x2019; said Rose Mbikwa, looking up at the large dark bird with elegant tail soaring high above the car park of the Nairobi Museum, a black kite. Which is, of course, not black but brown.&#x2019; Mr Malik smiled. How many times had he heard Rose Mbikwa say those words?<br>Almost as many times as he had been on the Tuesday morning bird walk.<br>You never know exactly how many kinds of birds you will see on the Tuesday morning bird walk of the East African Ornithological Society but you can be sure to see a kite. Expert scavengers, they thrive on the detritus of human society in and around Nairobi. At his first school sports day (how many years ago was that now could it really be fifty?) Mr Malik remembered little of the sprinting and javelin throwing and fathers&#x2019; sack race but he would never forget the kite which swooped down from nowhere to snatch a devilled chicken leg from his very hand. He could still recall the brush of feathers against his face and that single moment when as the bird&#x2019;s talons closed around the prize its yellow eye looked into his. Of course it wasn&#x2019;t quite accurate to say that he had no memories of the javelin throwing. Few would forget the incident with the Governor General&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s corgi.<br>There was already a good turnout. Seated along the low wall in front of the museum a gaggle of Young Ornithologists (YOs), mostly students training to be tourist guides, chattered and preened.<br>The Old Hands were also out in force.<br>Joan Baker and Hilary Fotherington-Thomas were leaning against a car talking to a couple of pink-faced men, one bearded, whose pocket-infested khaki clothing instantly identified them as tourists and their accents as Australian. Standing furtively to one side were Patsy King and Jonathan Evans.<br>They had been carrying on their Tuesday morning affair for almost two years now and though Mr Malik had never had an affair, he supposed that a certain furtiveness was necessary to achieve full satisfaction in these things. The two were an unlikely match. Imagine a giraffe, towering above the wide savannah. Now imagine a warthog. But Mr Malik was used to seeing the lanky figure of Patsy King striding along road or track, her 10 x 50 binoculars enveloped in one large hand, with Jonathan Evans trotting along beside her. To Mr Malik they seemed, like members of his own family, no longer remarkable.<br>Keeping himself to himself as usual was Thomas Nyambe. He was standing with his back to the crowd, looking up towards the sky, entranced. Mr Nyambe loved birds, and had been coming to the bird walks even longer than Mr Malik.<br>Tuesday was his rostered morning off from his job as government driver. A driver in Kenya is seldom paid enough to afford a car of his own, so as usual Mr Nyambe had walked to the museum from his home in Factory Road, just behind the railway station. As usual Mr Malik would offer him a lift to wherever they were going that day.<br>A bang and a rattle and a loud curse through an open window announced the arrival of Tom Turnbull driving over the speed bump in his yellow Morris Minor (the speed bump had been there over a year now but still it took him by surprise). He opened the door of the car, got out, and slammed it. He cursed, opened the door, and slammed it again.<br>The distant town hall clock struck nine.<br> Good morning and welcome,&#x2019; said Rose.<br>All conversation ceased, all heads turned.<br> I see a few new faces here and many old ones but I welcome all of you to the Tuesday morning bird walk. My name is Rose Mbikwa.&#x2019; Mr Malik had got used to it by now, the transformation of Rose&#x2019;s normal low contralto speaking voice into her public voice of distance-shrinking volume and clarity. Rose looked around the group, nodding here and smiling there, then conferred again with the young woman who had earlier pointed out the kite.<br> And to those of you who don&#x2019;t know her, may I introduce Jennifer Halutu. Just to remind you, I will be away next week and Jennifer will be leading the walk. Last week, you may remember, we thought we might try the MEATI but we didn&#x2019;t have enough cars. Do we have enough this week?&#x2019; She looked around the car park. I think we might.<br>Who can give lifts?&#x2019; Hands were raised, calculations made.<br> Good, that&#x2019;s fine,&#x2019; said Rose. Then the MEATI it is. You all know the way?&#x2019; It was left to Joan Baker and Hilary Fotherington-Thomas to explain to the mystified newcomers that the Modern East African Tourist Inn was a popular restaurant on the southern outskirts of town.<br>Thomas Nyambe had already slipped into the front seat of Mr Malik&#x2019;s old green Mercedes 450 SEL. The back seats were sttill empty. Perhaps, thought Mr Malik, the two tourists would like to come with him? He was about to offer a lift when another Mercedes, a shiny red SL 350, bounced in over the speed bump and swung into the car park. A tinted window opened, a sunglassssssed face leaned out over gold-braceleted arm.<br> Hi, Rose not too late?&#x2019; The man leapt out of the car. Hey, David, George, there you are. Your chariot awaits.&#x2019; The tourists, who Mr Malik now surmised were called David and George, walked over to the red Mercedes to be greeted with handshakes, smiles and shoulder clasps.<br> These guys are staying at the Hilton too, Rose, so I said they should come along. OK with you?&#x2019; After the three of them had gained Rose&#x2019;s approval and paid their visitor&#x2019;s subscription the two guests were shown into the passenger seats while the driver jumped back behind the wheel, started the engine and pulled out on to the drive, yelling out through the window just before it closed.<br> See you there, everyone.&#x2019; Who on earth was that? Brown skin, white hair, expensive clothing, and some kind of American accent; yet he looked slightly familiar. Mr Malik had little time to ponder this question, nor how this man seemed to know Rose Mbikwa, before several young black Africans piled into the back of his old Mercedes.<br>The rest of the YOs slipped and squeezed into Rose&#x2019;s 504, Tom&#x2019;s Morris Minor and the assortment of Land Rovers, Toyotas and other vehicles that other Old Hands had brought along. Engines were started, handbrakes released. As he drove gently over the speed bump and eased his tightly packed load out into the morning traffic, Mr Malik was wearing a worried expression.<br>That man. No, it couldn&#x2019;t be. Not after all this time.</p><h2>Rise and Shine: Better Breakfasts for Busy Mornings</h2><p><b>Give your kids--and yourself--something to rise and shine about! 75 recipes that make the first meal of the day worth waking up for.</b><br><i>Rise and Shine&nbsp;</i>is the answer for every parent who has struggled to get breakfast on the table and to get their child to actually eat it.

In Eat What is Set Before You, Scott Hagley offers a vivid picture of the habits and postures necessary for congregations to join God&#x2019;s mission in the neighborhood. Drawing from congregational research and his own experience as a pastor and consultant, Hagley describes three different crisis moments that congregations must navigate practically and understand theologically as they learn to dwell with and within their neighborhood. In so doing, he unearths the tensions, temptations, and possibilities missional churches face in the current North American context.---Endorsements:&#x201c;If your church sets out to become a life-giving presence in the neighborhood, you're in for a wild ride! It all seems simple enough, until you start doing it. That&#x2019;s why you need this book. It is going to give you astonishing insight into what you have been going through as a church. It is going to give you a rich practical theology for understanding how to improvise for what's coming next. And it is taken from a deeply personal and particular account of Scott Hagley's experience of participating in a neighborhood church, which makes it resonate deeply and concretely with your real experience. This is one of the most helpful guidebooks I have encountered in the past twenty years of parish ministry.&#x201d;- Paul SparksCo-Author of the award-winning book The New Parish: How Neighborhood Churches Are Transforming Mission, Discipleship, and Community and Co-founding Director of the Parish Collective."Finally&#x2014;a book that develops a usable congregational missiology!

Where Volume I presented St Symeon&#39;s treatments of the Church, the sacraments, and the &#39;Day of the Lord,&#39; in this collection the reader finds him addressing the traditional language of Eastern Christian asceticism in the light of his message. Apatheia, or &#39;dispassion,&#39; the ancient term for freedom from sinful passion, is insisted on by Symeon as denoting the real possibility of a transfigured life. Elsewhere, he takes up the role of the tools of asceticism, i.e., fasting, vigils, poverty, etc., in order to underline their function as instruments enabling conformity to the Cross of Christ. Other discourses dwell on the character and signs of the saint, on faith and love, and on ascetic retreat. Throughout, St Symeon anticipates the great fourteenth-century movement of Byzantine hesychasm, as well as the monastic renaissance of eighteenth-century Athos and nineteenth-century Russia. On the Mystical Life is part of the POPULAR PATRISTIC SERIES.</p><p>Fr Alexander Golitzin is Associate Professor of Theology at Marquette University.

When Charles Prentice arrives in Spain to investigate his brother&#39;s involvement in the death of five people in a fire in the upmarket coastal resort of Estrella de Mar, he gradually discovers that beneath the civilised, cultured surface of this exclusive enclave for Britain&#39;s retired rich there flourishes a secret world of crime, drugs and illicit sex . What starts as an engrossing mystery develops into a mesmerising novel of ideas -- a dazzling work of the imagination from one of Britain&#39;s most original and controversial novelists -- author of &#39;Empire of the Sun&#39; and &#39;Crash&#39;.</p><p>When travel writer Charles Prentice arrives at Estrella de Mar, a resort town near Gibraltar populated primarily by British retirees, to find out why his brother Frank has been jailed, he's shocked to find that Frank has confessed to a spectacular act of arson that left five people dead. Charles tries to find the real culprit by hanging around Estrella de Mar, which one resident describes as "like Chelsea or Greenwich Village in the 1960s. There are theatre and film clubs, a choral society, cordon blue classes.... Stand still for a moment and you find yourself roped into a revival of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>." But the longer he stays, the more confused Charles is by the residents' breezy lack of concern about the constant background of vandalism, rape, prostitution, and drug dealing.<p> Things become clearer as Charles makes the acquaintance of local tennis pro Bobby Crawford, who has some interesting hypotheses about how to maintain the quality of the inner life in the age of affluence. As another of the locals explains, "Leisure societies lie ahead of us, like those you see on this coast. People ... will retire in their late thirties, with fifty years of idleness in front of them.... But how do you energize people, give them some sense of community?" Bobby's succinct answer, provided to Charles in another context: "There's nothing like a violent reflex now and then to tune up the nervous system." Bobby convinces Charles to help him replicate his social experiment in an adjacent retirement community, slowly convincing him that crime and creativity really do go hand in hand. But who, if anybody, takes the responsibility?</p><p> <i>Cocaine Nights</i> resonates quite neatly with Ballard's earlier science fiction and experimental stories. As early as <i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i>, Ballard was speculating about the salubrious effects of transgression, and his science fiction novel <i>High Rise</i> also deals with the introduction of violence to a self-contained paradise. <i>Cocaine Nights</i> differs from that earlier work primarily in that it is a naturalistic fiction set in a world that is much more ostensibly real, a world that, with a little less detached theorizing (even at his most natural, it seems, Ballard cannot help but be clinical) on the part of its characters, might even be mistaken for real. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>J. G. Ballard was born in 1930 in Shanghai. After internment in a civilian prison camp, his family returned to England in 1946. His 1984 bestseller `Empire of the Sun&#39; won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His controversial novel `Crash&#39; was made into a film by David Cronenberg. His autobiography `Miracles of Life&#39; was published in 2008, and a collection of interviews with the author, `Extreme Metaphors&#39;, was published in 2012. J. G.

With its open-armed embrace of manufacturing, Newark, New Jersey, rode the Industrial Revolution to great prominence and wealth that lasted well into the twentieth century. In the postwar years, however, Newark experienced a perfect storm of urban troubles�political corruption, industrial abandonment, white flight, racial conflict, crime, poverty. Cities across the United States found themselves in similar predicaments, yet Newark stands out as an exceptional case. Its saga reflects the rollercoaster ride of Everycity U.S.A., only with a steeper rise, sharper turns, and a much more dramatic plunge.<p><i>How Newark Became Newark</i> is a fresh, unflinching popular history that spans the city's epic transformation from a tiny Puritan village into a manufacturing powerhouse, on to its desperate struggles in the twentieth century and beyond. After World War II, unrest mounted as the minority community was increasingly marginalized, leading to the wrenching civic disturbances of the 1960s. Though much of the city was crippled for years, How Newark Became Newark is also a story of survival and hope. Today, a real estate revival and growing population are signs that Newark is once again in ascendance.</p></p><p>This sweeping popular history is the unflinching story of one of America&#39;s most fascinating cities. Brad R. Tuttle&#39;s illustrated account is fresh and honest--a critical tale that does not shy away from Newark&#39;s sometime seedy past. From its abrupt and steady decline following WWII to today&#39;s more hopeful future spurned on by a new real estate market and a growing population, How Newark Became Newark follows well-known and long-forgotten characters and significant events embodying the overall rise, fall, and rebirth of New Jersey&#39;s biggest city.BRAD R.

Trump as president of the United States. Now, after a short and turbulent tenure in the White House, Steve Bannon is working on the outside to propel forward his populist agenda even when it puts him at odds with the Trump administration. Unafraid to speak the truth and unwilling to back down, Bannon has made headlines in recent months for slamming the Trump administration's approach to North Korea and China, backing controversial Senate candidate Roy Moore at all costs, and calling members of Trump's circle&#x2014;including Trump's son Don Jr. and his son-in-law Jared Kushner&#x2014;"treasonous" for meeting with Russians during the election.<br><br>What is Steve Bannon trying to achieve?

She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Greenwood&#39;s flapper heroine, Phrynne (FRYnie) Fisher, is improbable but completely delightful, especially in the elegant performance of Stephanie Daniel, a master of the sophisticated deadpan delivery that makes this P.G. Wodehouse-style of comedy work. The setup: Phrynne is driving her Hispano Suiza past Victoria Dock one night when her windshield explodes. Two fleeing thugs fire more shots at her, and she finds a very beautiful young man dying of bullet wounds. This annoys her greatly as there are too few beautiful young men in the world as it is. She assembles her team of orphaned wards, freelance enforcers, and devoted staff and all too soon has sorted out a nest of murderous anarchists and solved an unrelated kidnapping along the way.

He walks in sweltering heat and numbing cold. He will walk without stopping until he falls asleep, wherever he is. This curious affliction has baffled medical experts around the globe--and come perilously close to ruining what should be a happy life. Tim has a loving family, a successful law career, and a beautiful suburban home, all of which he maintains spectacularly well until his feet start moving again. <br><br>What drives a man to stay in a marriage, in a job? What forces him away? Is love or conscience enough to overcome the darker, stronger urges of the natural world? THE UNNAMED is a deeply felt, luminous novel about modern life, ancient yearnings, and the power of human understanding.<br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2010</strong>: <i>It's back.</i> With those words Tim and Jane Farnsworth reenter a nightmare they know so intimately it needs no other description. "It" may not be found among an insurance company's diagnostic codes, but the Farnsworths, a couple made wealthy by Tim's single-mindedly successful legal practice, know it too well: Tim's compulsion, at any random moment of the day or night, to set out walking for hours at a time until he collapses in exhaustion. They've survived two bouts of this inexplicable illness, which began as mysteriously as they ended, and now, as Joshua Ferris's second novel, <i>The Unnamed</i>, opens, they are beset by a third. Ferris's first book, <i>Then We Came to the End</i>, was one of the freshest, most acclaimed fiction debuts of the decade, but he's followed it not with an imitation or extension but with something thrillingly different. Like Tim possessed in one of his perambulatory vectors, Ferris follows his character's condition as far as it leads him, far beyond where logic and loyalty usually take our lives, but always treats it with empathy, grace, and imagination. His language is as exact and poetic as his premise is fantastic, and by the story's end you feel the title refers not only to his hero's strange and solitary disease but also to those elemental but equally inexplicable forces that bind us together through the most difficult turns of our fated lives. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Joshua Ferris's first novel, <i>Then We Came to the End</i>, has been translated into 24 languages. His fiction has appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Granta</i>, and <i>Best American Voices</i>.

The enemy was too powerful, too numerous, and utterly determined to exterminate humanity. But the appearance of a new ally in the fight has changed all of that. For the first time since the original incursion Wolfe thinks that maybe there&#x2019;s a chance to stop their implacable enemy before they have the chance to wipe out any more human planets. That opportunity comes at great cost, however, and even as he makes plans for their first offensive move on the Phage, Jackson is all too aware that most of them will not survive. &#x201c;Counterstrike&#x201d; is book three of the bestselling Black Fleet Trilogy.</p><p></p><h2>A History of Apologetics</h2><p>Making the case for the Christian faith--apologetics--has always been part of the Church's mission. Yet Christians sometimes have had different approaches to defending the faith, responding to the needs of their respective times and framing their arguments to address the particular issues of their day. Cardinal Avery Dulles's <i>A History of Apologetics</i> provides a masterful overview of Christian apologetics, from its beginning in the New Testament through the Middle Ages and on to the present resurgence of apologetics among Catholics and Protestants. Dulles shows how Christian apologists have at times both criticized and drawn from their intellectual surroundings to present the reasonableness of Christian belief. Written by one of Catholicism's leading American theologians, <i>A History of Apologetics</i> also examines apologetics in the 20th and early 21st centuries including its decline among Catholics following Vatican II and its recent revival, as well as the contributions of contemporary Evangelcal Protestant apologists. Dulles also considers the growing Catholic-Protestant convergence in apologetics. No student of apologetics and contemporary theology should be without this superb and masterful work.</p><p>REVISED UPDATED EDITION (AUGUST 2005)Cardinal Avery Dulles, S.J., is the author of over 700 articles and 22 books. He has served on the International Theological Commission and as a member of the United States Lutheran/Roman Catholic Coordinating Committee.

Marcus Tullius Cicero was a preeminent Roman statesman, orator, and philosopher who introduced philosophy into Rome, and through Rome, into Christendom and the modern world. <i>On Duties</i> was championed by important thinkers including Thomas Aquinas, Montesquieu, and Voltaire, and it was one of the earliest books printed on the Gutenberg press. </p><p>The true significance of<i> On Duties</i> lies in its examination of several fundamental problems of political philosophy, the most important being the possible conflict between the honorable and the useful. The honorable encompasses the virtues of human beings, which include justice and concern for the common good. The useful refers to the needs of living beings, which includes certain necessities and concern for private good. Only by understanding the possible conflict between these two sides of human nature, Cicero declares, may we understand our duties to our community and to ourselves. This new edition of<i> On Duties</i> aims to provide readers who cannot read Latin but wish to study the book with a literal yet elegant translation.

Richard Nixon's 1969 presidential order that declared CIA covert operations necessary to the attainment of American foreign policy goals was an acknowledgment that secret warfare tools had a much wider application than just the cold war conflict with the Soviet Union. The question of what, exactly, these operations have contributed to U.S. policy has long been neglected in the rush to accuse the CIA of being a "rogue elephant" or merely listing its nefarious deeds. <i>Safe for Democracy</i> for the first time places the story of the CIA's covert operations squarely in the context of America's global quest for democratic values and institutions. National security historian John Prados offers a comprehensive history of the CIA's secret wars that is as close to a definitive account as is possible today. He draws on three decades of research to illuminate the men and women of the intelligence establishment, their resources and techniques, their triumphs and failures. In a dramatic and revealing narrative, <i>Safe for Democracy</i> not only relates the inside stories of covert operations but examines in meticulous detail the efforts of presidents and Congress to control the CIA and the specific choices made in the agency's secret wars. Along the way Mr. Prados offers eye-opening accounts of the covert actions themselves, from radically revised interpretations of classic operations like Iran, Guatemala, Chile, and the Bay of Pigs; to lesser-known projects like Tibet and Angola; to virtually unknown tales of the CIA in Guyana and Ghana. He supplies full accounts of Reagan-era operations in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and brings the story up to date with accounts of more recent activities in Somalia, Bosnia, and Iraq, all the while keeping American foreign policy goals in view. <i>Safe for Democracy&lt;</i></p><p>John Prados is widely recognized as one of the foremost historians of national security affairs. A Columbia University Ph.D., his major books include <i>Presidents' Secret Wars, Pentagon Games, Keepers of the Keys, Inside the Pentagon Papers, The Blood Road, Valley of Decision, The Hidden History of the Vietnam War,</i> and <i>Combined Fleet Decoded</i>.

Introduced shortly after the American Civil War, the very first Winchester, the M1866, would go on to see military service as far afield as Bulgaria, but it was in the hands of civilians that it would become known as &#39;The gun that won the west.&#39; Offering a lethal combination of portability, ruggedness and ammunition interchangeability with pistol sidearms, the Winchesters and their innovative and elegant breech-loading system represented a revolutionary design. They were used by a staggering variety of military and civilian groups - gold-miners, trappers, hunters, farmers, lawmen, professional gunmen and Native Americans. It equipped a whole generation of settlers and as such left an imprint on American culture that continues to resonate today. This book explores the Winchesters&#39; unique place in the history of firearms, revealing the technical secrets of their success with a full array of color artwork, period illustrations and close-up photographs.</p><p>Martin Pegler has a BA Hons in Medieval and Modern History and an MA in Museum Studies, both from University College, London, and was for many years the Senior Curator of Firearms at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds. Martin has established The Somme Historical Centre (www.martinpegler.com), where visitors can see the technology used in the 1914-18 trench warfare. He is currently an author and firearms consultant and he also lectures at local Great War museums. He is the author of a number of books including The Military Sniper since 1914 (Osprey, 2001), Firearms in the American West 1700-1900 (The Crowood Press, 2002), and the highly acclaimed Out of Nowhere: A History of the Military Sniper (Osprey, 2004), and he has also contributed to a number of magazines. In the 1980s he had the privilege of interviewing many World War I veterans about their wartime experiences, and the recordings are now part of the sound archives of the Imperial War Museum, London.

Thousands of its followers have marched across Syria and Iraq, subjugating millions, enslaving women, beheading captives, and daring anyone to stop them. Thousands more have spread terror beyond the Middle East under the Islamic State's black flag. </p><p>How did the Islamic State attract so many followers and conquer so much land? By being more ruthless, more apocalyptic, and more devoted to state-building than its competitors. The shrewd leaders of the Islamic State combined two of the most powerful yet contradictory ideas in Islam-the return of the Islamic Empire and the end of the world-into a mission and a message that shapes its strategy and inspires its army of zealous fighters. They have defied conventional thinking about how to wage wars and win recruits. Even if the Islamic State is defeated, jihadist terrorism will never be the same.</p><p> Based almost entirely on primary sources in Arabic-including ancient religious texts and secret al-Qaeda and Islamic State letters that few have seen - William McCants' <i>The ISIS Apocalypse</i> explores how religious fervor, strategic calculation, and doomsday prophecy shaped the Islamic State's past and foreshadow its dark future.</p></p><p><b>William McCants </b><b></b>directs the project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution.

Yet Will McCants's <i>ISIS Apocalypse </i>is lucid, thoughtful and illuminating on the group, its history, ideology and personalities.

We stayed in a little town where there was a harbour and fishing boats and fishermen. They sailed away to catch herrings in nets. When the boats came back home again some had only caught a few herring.

Decadent cascades of fragrant wisteria spilling over a stone pergola. Rustling leaves along an all�e of delicate crepe myrtle trees. Waving blossoms of roses, sage, and hydrangeas&#x2014;along a salty shoreline. Edmund Hollander Landscape Architects creates gardens filled with unexpected textures, colors, and sounds meant to appeal to all the senses, inviting us to truly live in the landscape.<br><br> This volume presents dozens of gorgeous estate gardens throughout the Northeast, approached thematically; individual sections reveal how components such as gateways, paths, pool terraces, bosques and groves, walls, and borders contribute to lush garden rooms, windblown seaside gardens, calming meadow gardens, intricate formal gardens, and shady tracts of woodland. Over 300 color photographs of beautiful properties in the Hamptons, Connecticut, and upstate New York <br> provide glimpses of the best garden design happening today while breaking down its ideas for the home gardener.&nbsp;<br><br> Evocative text by <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Landscape Architecture</i> columnist Anne Raver details how the firm works to envelop visitors in landscapes that feel entirely whole: plantings near architecture create a dynamic entry progression; hardscape features that lead out into a broader garden gradually cede to more natural, living elements; pools are surrounded by gracious swaths of flowers that bloom in sequence as the season progresses to provide privacy for bathers and a sense of quiet seclusion. The ideas presented here will help owners of gardens of every size enjoy their land to the fullest.</p><p>Edmund Hollander and Maryanne Connelly have been involved with environmental planning and design projects for over twenty-five years. Since founding Edmund Hollander Design in 1989, they have designed gardens and landscapes at every scale in the Hamptons, Long Island&#x2019;s north shore, Connecticut, Westchester, New Jersey, Virginia, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean. Hollander Design projects have appeared in numerous publications including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, and <i>House Beautiful</i>, as well as in numerous books on landscapes and gardens.<br><br> The firm was awarded the 2006 American Society of Landscape Architects Honor Award in residential design and the 2012 Stanford White Award in Landscape Architecture from the Institute for Classical Architecture, and has won numerous awards from the New York chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects as well as the New York and Connecticut chapters of the American Institute of Architects. Hollander was recently elected a Fellow in the American Society of Landscape Architects and was honored with the New York School of Interior Design&#x2019;s Thomas N. Armstrong III Award in Landscape Design in 2015."These two landscape architects had served as ever-patient mentors in my early days of garden writing for <i>Newsday</i>, on Long Island, when I hardly knew a perennial from a petunia, and later for the <i>New York Times</i>, when I was stretching out into writing about public parks, environmental restoration and landscape architecture. No question was too small. No time too busy. For the months we were working on <i>The Good Garden</i>, we three spent a few hours every week talking about the essence of good design. For instance, they may plant an all�e of Natchez crepe myrtles marching down to a Hamptons beach because these icons of such Southern cities as Charleston and Savannah are tolerant of salt winds and lean soils. Or they may use a single London plane tree, with its high spreading branches, as an airy ceiling for a summer terrace. And they&#x2019;d be loath to bulldoze a cluster of wild cherry trees, their trunks and limbs sculpted by the wind, as other designers might do in order to create an uninterrupted lawn."<br>&#x2014;<b>Anne Raver, 1st Dibs' <i>Introspective Magazine</i><br></b><br>"Known for his prolific work on the estates of New York's Long Island, Edmund Hollander creates grand gardens to embrace the palatial homes that dot the enclaves of the Hamptons: majestic oak all�es leading to shingled manses, sharply sculpted hedges ringing sleek contemporary piles. In <i>The Good Garden</i>, Hollander explores the alchemy that connects landscape to residence. The volume, helpfully divided into sections by element&#x2014;such as borders, hedges, and pool plantings&#x2014;offers verdant insight into the poetic ways nature can improve and enhance architecture. It's lush, leafy escapism of the highest order." <br>&#x2014;<b><i>Veranda</i></b><br><br>"Large or small, a pool under the sun is the quintessence of summertime in the Hamptons.

An interview with James Brown to promote a local show in Virginia led to an opportunity to promote one of Brown&#x2019;s concerts, which then led to Brown hiring him to help run his tours. Soon Leeds was wearing many hats and traveling around the country as Brown battled a complicated web of local promoters and managers, all too willing to try to rip him off.<br> <br> In this riveting book&#x2014;part memoir, part history&#x2014;Leeds weaves a wholly new and remarkable portrait of Brown as an idiosyncratic iconoclast, determined artist, and forceful businessman. It is a rare look into a world little known to white America immediately following the Civil Rights Movement. Leeds discovers that Brown is a fascinatingly complex man and their experiences, both business and personal, range from emotional to humorous. All the while, they navigate the complicated world of popular Black music in America, told by someone who actually lived it.<br> <br> &#x201c;Over the course of his long life in music as a tour manager, archivist, writer, and fan, Alan Leeds had a ringside seat for some of the greatest moments in soul and funk history&#x2014;from James Brown in the sixties to Prince in the eighties to D&#x2019;Angelo in the first years of the 21st century.

Lewis canon, How to Pray offers a deeper understanding of our personal tradition of prayer, our faith, and what is means to be a Christian.</p><p>CLIVE STAPLES LEWIS (1898-1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably one of the most influential writers of his day. He was a fellow and tutor in English Literature at Oxford University until 1954, when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include Mere Christianity, Out of the Silent Planet, The Great Divorce, The Screwtape Letters, and the universally acknowledged classic, The Chronicles of Narnia. To date, the Narnia books have sold over 100 million copies.`He has quite a unique power for making theology an attractive, exciting and fascinating quest.&#39; Times Literary Supplement `I find I am constantly realising that I owe many of my most basic convictions about Christian faith to Lewis&#39;s imagination&#39; Rowan Williams</p><h2>American Tall Tales (The Jim Weiss Audio Collection)</h2><p><p><strong>Renowned storyteller Jim Weiss brings you lively versions of classic American tall tales, from stories of giant lumberjacks to legends of fearless cowboys.</strong></p> You will laugh out loud as you meet Paul Bunyan, taller than the trees and mightier than the rivers; Johnny Appleseed, whose gentle generosity makes him a beloved legend; Pecos Bill, whose outrageous Texas-sized exploits make him the greatest of all cowboys; and Jim's original tale of the Wild West.</p><p>In 1989, Jim Weiss set out on a mission: to record the greatest stories he knew from world literature and history, and inspire families -- especially young listeners -- with a passionate love of the original classics. In the three decades since then, Jim's narration voice and seemingly numberless character voices have formed foundational entertainment and education for millions of listeners around the world.<br> Winning hundreds of awards, Jim&#x2019;s recordings range on the literary side from fairy tales through stories from Shakespeare, Dickens and Conan Doyle, while his history recordings bring to vivid life major historical events and personalities from the ancient world through the twentieth century.<br> The inspiration for all this began early, with parents and grandparents who told stories and read aloud to him, skills which Jim joyously acquired, and which led him to a degree in Communications and Speech from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Later, his wife, Randy, earned her own national awards as a teacher and counselor, and their shared passion for learning led to forming their company in 1989, long before the explosion of spoken word recordings made this a "sensible" decision. The recordings began winning listeners and national awards from the first. A few years ago, the Weiss's licensed their recordings and business operations to Well-Trained Mind Press, which has successfully introduced Jim's work into still more markets, while Jim continues to write, record, teach and perform. <strong><br></strong></p><h2>The Founders and the Classics: Greece, Rome, and the American Enlightenment</h2><p><p>Is our Greek and Roman heritage merely allusive and illusory? Or were our founders, and so our republican beginnings, truly steeped in the stuff of antiquity? So far largely a matter of generalization and speculation, the influence of Greek and Roman authors on our American forefathers finally becomes clear in this fascinating book-the first comprehensive study of the founders&#x2019; classical reading.</p><p>Carl J. Richard begins by examining how eighteenth-century social institutions in general and the educational system in particular conditioned the founders to venerate the classics. He then explores the founders&#x2019; various uses of classical symbolism, models, &#x201c;antimodels,&#x201d; mixed government theory, pastoralism, and philosophy, revealing in detail the formative influence exerted by the classics, both directly and through the mediation of Whig and American perspectives. In this analysis, we see how the classics not only supplied the principal basis for the U.S. Constitution but also contributed to the founders&#x2019; conception of human nature, their understanding of virtue, and their sense of identity and purpose within a grand universal scheme. At the same time, we learn how the classics inspired obsessive fear of conspiracies against liberty, which poisoned relations between Federalists and Republicans.</p><p>The shrewd ancients who molded Western civilization still have much to teach us, Richard suggests. His account of the critical role they played in shaping our nation and our lives provides a valuable lesson in the transcendent power of the classics.</p></p><p>Carl J.

Poetry didn't pay the bills, so he worked on Wall Street, spending his nights at the happenings, underground movie premiers, art shows, and poetry readings that brought the city to life. An intense romantic relationship with Andy Warhol&#x2015;not yet the global superstar he would soon become&#x2015;exposed Giorno to even more of the downtown scene, but after starring in Warhol's first movie, <i>Sleep</i>, they drifted apart. Giorno soon found himself involved with Robert Rauschenberg and later Jasper Johns, both relationships fueling his creativity. He quickly became a renowned poet in his own right, working at the intersection of literature and technology, freely crossing genres and mediums alongside the likes of William Burroughs and Brion Gysin.</p><p><i>Great Demon Kings </i>is the memoir of a cultural pioneer: an openly gay man at a time when many artists remained closeted and shunned gay subject matter, and a devout Buddhist whose faith acted as a rudder during a life of tremendous animation, one full of fantastic highs and frightening lows. Studded with appearances by nearly every it-boy and girl of the downtown scene (including a moving portrait of a decades-long friendship with Burroughs), this book offers a joyous, life-affirming, and sensational look at New York City during its creative peak, narrated in the unforgettable voice of one of its most singular characters.</p></p><p><b>John Giorno </b>is a New York&#x2013;based poet and performance artist and the founder of Giorno Poetry Systems.

During his first summer, Spencer built a sheltered viewing platform, a place to sit with Sis and his notebook, and observe the denizens of the pool for months, and, finally, years on end. Shortly before setting up camp during his first season, Spencer cut the points off the hooks of all his steelhead flies, freeing himself to see more deeply the beauty of his surroundings. As the predatory urge faded, a kind of blindness went with it, and Spencer&#x2019;s eyes and mind became figurative hooks, enabling him to capture the stunning lives and behaviors of these charismatic wild creatures with an intimacy that has rarely been offered before. </p><p>A distillation of fourteen years of detailed observations, in this surprisingly engaging almanac, Spencer records a natural history teeming with fish, water, vegetation, birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians, seasonal changes, and interesting events and stories. Spencer is a modern-day Thoreau, and the steelhead pool is his Walden Pond.</p></p><p>Lee Spencer was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1950 and was raised in Minnesota.&nbsp; After being awarded a Master&#x2019;s in Anthropology in 1978 by the University of Oregon, he worked as a field archeologist for more than twenty years, mostly in the desert west and often excavating dry rock shelters.&nbsp; He has cast flies for steelhead on his river of choice, the North Umpqua, for the last thirty-five years and, in 1999, with his good dog, Sis, he began volunteering with The North Umpqua Foundation at Big Bend Pool.&#x201c;From these pages flows the elusive beauty that compels the defense of wild rivers.&#x201d; &#x2013; Matt Stoecker, Ecologist and producer of the documentary <i>DamNation</i> (Patagonia, 2014)<br><br>As an intricate tapestry of aquatic and riparian life is revealed to him, year after year, season by season, Lee Spencer&#x2019;s pool becomes not just a refuge but a sanctuary.<br>What is the holiness we glimpse there?&nbsp;Laotse calls it &#x201c;the Mysterious Female."

He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic. While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as <i>Derek Prince Legacy Radio.</i> In 2002 he said, &#x201c;It is my desire&#x2014;and I believe the Lord&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;that this ministry continue the work, which God began through me over sixty years ago, until Jesus returns.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Your Best Destiny: Becoming the Person You Were Created to Be</h2><p>When you imagine what it would take for your life to be truly great&#x2015;for you to become your best, most fulfilled self&#x2015;do you dream of something more than what you have now?

At one point he gave up a successful career in photojournalism to devote his time to researching the Templars for a film project. He lives in England and is the author of numerous books on ancient Christianity and conspiracy.The trio of authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), which traced a Merovingian bloodline for Jesus, continue their inquiry into the origins of Christianity in this sequel. With zeal they search many contexts for the Jesus of history, rather than the Christ of faith, and begin by discounting the Gospels as reliable historical documents. From material culled from many disciplines, they arrive at a speculative, controversial image of Jesus greatly at variance with received Christian tradition. As in the earlier book, the authors rely heavily on the mysterious Prieure de Sion, alleged custodian of the Holy Grail. The inquiry presented here is an interesting melange of the factual and the imagined, of centuries-connected clues and serendipitous happenings involving such disparate offices as the CIA, the Vatican and the Mafia, among many. Those who believe in global conspiracies will enjoy the intrigue; others may be rightfully bemused.

Opening Day was postponed and later played in the shadow of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s funeral. That summer, as the pennant races were heating up, the assassination of Robert Kennedy was later followed by rioting at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. But even as tensions boiled over and violence spilled into the streets, something remarkable was happening in major league ballparks across the country. Pitchers were dominating like never before, and with records falling and shut-outs mounting, many began hailing '68 as The Year of the Pitcher.&#x201d;<br>In <i>Summer of '68</i>, Tim Wendel takes us on a wild ride through a season that saw such legends as Bob Gibson, Denny McLain, Don Drysdale, and Luis Tiant set new standards for excellence on the mound, each chasing perfection against the backdrop of one of the most divisive and turbulent years in American history. For some players, baseball would become an insular retreat from the turmoil encircling them that season, but for a select few, including Gibson and the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals, the conflicts of '68 would spur their performances to incredible heights and set the stage for their own run at history.<br>Meanwhile in Detroit which had burned just the summer before during one of the worst riots in American history '68 instead found the city rallying together behind a colorful Tigers team led by McLain, Mickey Lolich, Willie Horton, and Al Kaline. The Tigers would finish atop the American League, setting themselves on a highly anticipated collision course with Gibson's Cardinals. And with both teams' seasons culminating in a thrilling World Series for the ages one team playing to establish a dynasty, the other fighting to help pull a city from the ashes what ultimately lay at stake was something even larger: baseball's place in a rapidly changing America that would never be the same.<br>In vivid, novelistic detail, <i>Summer of '68 </i>tells the story of this unforgettable season the last before rule changes and expansion would alter baseball forever when the country was captivated by the national pastime at the moment it needed the game most.</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><br><br></p><p><p><b>Tim Wendel</b> is the author of nine books, including <i>High Heat</i>, <i>Far From Home</i>, <i>Red Rain</i>, and <i>Castro&#x2019;s Curveball</i>.

Here, in volumes three and four, Gibbon vividly recounts the waves of barbarian invaders under commanders such as Alaric and Attila, who overran and eventually destroyed the West.

Lilith, the eternal root of the sacred feminine from humankind&#x2019;s spiritual genesis, symbolizes archetypally this role women once held by sacred design and divine intent. They were known as the Keepers of the Flame, those who oversaw and guided the way humans organized themselves in all affairs that governed their lives. The foundation for their way of life was based upon Natural Law versus man-made laws. One of its core principles was the universal practice of giving, sharing and including. The purpose of this work is to reach out to those who want to go beyond patriarchal conditioning by showing that the history we have been led and taught to believe as true, especially about womankind, is false. In fact, what is true about human nature and its original way of life came before the patriarchy, what is referred to as the matriarchy. The original archetype of Lilith is described based on the teachings of Jeffrey Wolf Green with the intent to help bolster and invigorate every woman&#x2019;s spirit by showing her the way back home to her own natural self; to stand again as one individual who exists as part of a group consciousness, the species human, interwoven into an even larger family comprised of all Earth&#x2019;s sacred beings, and by doing so, to reconnect to the Spirit that dwells within each and every heart linking all to her own, and to relearn how to speak its Truths with passion and conviction for the benefit of all. That is Lilith. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ You will know truth when it speaks to your soul. It is a knowingness that simply exists beyond the words. As I read through the book, I felt an immediate resonance with the concepts put forth by the author. I learned, I absorbed, I embraced. Somehow I remembered. The remembering felt as natural as breath in, breath out. Great educators like Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell have described how ancient myths continue to inform and live on within our collective unconscious. Our great spiritual teachers, many of whom are referenced within the pages of this book, remind each one of us of our connection to universal source, to the divinity that exists within each one of us. They invite us to embark on the journey inward, to reconnect with our center, our soul, and with the source of all that is. In this luminous book, the author exquisitely and simply synthesizes the knowledge imparted by the spiritual masters regarding our Creatress force. She speaks of the transgender whole of the sacred feminine in its unfiltered and unconditioned version. This is not the Lilith story with the overlay of patriarchal conditionings that give an explanation for humanity&#x2019;s spiritual downfall, but rather that of her preHerstory - of the unified, fecund and regenerative Creatress seed from which all life has sprung. I invite you to allow your own knowingness to verify the truth contained within these pages. Don&#x2019;t read this book - experience it, for yourself, for your soul. . . .

In an elegant and accessible style that combines thoroughly documented sociological insight with her own compelling personal narrative, Pem Buck illustrates the ways in which constructions of race and the promise of white privilege have been used at specific historical moments to divide those in the United Statesspecifically, in two Kentucky countieswho might have otherwise acted on common class interests. From the initial creation of the concept of "whiteness" and early strategies focused on convincing Europeans, regardless of their class position, to identify with the eliteto believe that what was good for the elite was good for themto the moment between 1750 and 1800 when most people who were identified by their European descent finally came to believe that skin color was as integral to their identity as gender, the promise of white privilege underpinned the Kentucky system.<br> Pem Buck examines the long term effects of these developments and discusses their impact on the lives of working people in Kentucky. She also analyzes the role of local tobacco-growing and corporate elites in the underdevelopment of the state, highlighting the ways in which relationships between poor white and poor black working people were continuously manipulated to facilitate that process.<br> Documentary material includes speeches, songs, photographs, charts, cartoons, and ads presented in a large, visually appealing format.</p></p><p><b>Pem Davidson Buck</b> is Professor Emerita of Anthropology at Elizabethtown Community and Technical College in Kentucky.

Having learned to cook in her grandmother&#x2019;s kitchen, shopping at farm stands, and making preserves, she couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder, Do people here really eat swampy broccoli, iceberg lettuce, and fried chicken for lunch everyday?&#x201d;<br><br>These assumptions quickly faded as she began to explore farmers markets and the burgeoning co-op scene in the Twin Cities and eventually discovered a local food movement strong enough to survive the toughest winter. From the husband and wife who run one of the largest organic farms in the region to Native Americans harvesting wild rice, and from award-winning cheesemakers to Hmong immigrant farmers growing the best sweet potatoes in the country, a rich ecosystem of farmers, artisanal producers, and restaurateurs comes richly to life in this fascinating book, demonstrating that even in a place with a short growing season, food grown locally and organically can be healthy, community-based, environmentally conscious, and most of all delicious. <br></p><p><b>Beth Dooley</b> is the author of six books and cookbooks including, with Lucia Watson, <i>Savoring the Seasons of the Northern Heartland</i> (a James Beard Nominee) and <i>Minnesota&#x2019;s Bounty: The Farmers Market Cookbook</i>.

She lives in Minneapolis.<br><b>Finalist for the Minnesota Book Award</b><br><br> Dooley does much more than recycle familiar arguments for eating local; she personalizes the path from farm to fork with heart and skill.

In Ms. Dooley&#x2019;s world, 'kids drank cider because milk was reserved for making butter and cheese.'

Certainly a message to love."<i><b> Huffington Post</b></i><br> In this homage to local food, Dooley paints an exquisite portrait. Each of Dooley&#x2019;s twelve chapters showcases a different local food such as apples, wheat, chestnuts, cranberries, corn, wild rice, and sweet potatoes. The author includes a few recipes but explains that this is not a cookbook; rather, it is the story of the author building relationships with the small, independent farmers, processors, and chefs&#x2019; who make their living building and contributing to local economies throughout the Upper Midwest.&#x201d;<b> <i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> Beth Dooley has written the book we need, a collection of stories about the foods we eat in winter, the season that is so often ignored, as if it doesn&#x2019;t count somehow, or even exist.

Each chapter celebrates the relationship between land and culture, from Anishinaabek wild rice to Hmong sweet potatoes. Her warm inviting prose invites you to the kitchen table and reminds you of what we&#x2019;re all really hungry for connection.

She says of this book: <p>"When prayer began to come alive inside of me, I was fascinated and embarrassed, captivated and confused. I had long since given up any rigid notion of an anthropomorphic, judging God, yet here I was in intimate dialogue with something bigger than myself. I didn't know quite what to make of this. </p><p>Over time, as I looked closely at my prayer life, I uncovered a remarkable fact: the very act of personally addressing the Infinite opened me to a different experience of self and other, one in which I sensed divinity as an interior part of all things. </p><p>Prayers are my attempt to translate into words some of my deepest inner longings. They are an offering of passion, love, fear, anxiety, gratitude, and pain. Praying is one way to connect with Spirit. A doorway to the fluid and creative energy I call God, Lord, the One, Beloved, the Infinite, or All That Is. </p><p>Inevitably this dialogue began to find its way into my poetry and this book is the result. It is an eclectic mix of prayer-poems and other poetry arising in my yoga and meditation practice, my observations of the natural world, and from facing life as it has come to me over the last year.</p></p><p>Danna Faulds is a practitioner and teacher of Kripalu Yoga, a poet who writes about the mysteries revealed in spiritual practice. A former librarian who worked in law school, college and public libraries before turning to full-time writing, Danna lives with her husband Richard in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Happily married for twenty years, they tend an organic vegetable garden, enjoy the birds and wildlife on their rural property, and host individuals and groups interested in the deeper practices of Kripalu Yoga.</p><h2>Letters from Christopher: The Tragic Confessions of the Watts Family Murders</h2><p><p>In the early morning hours of August 13, 2018, in the small, quiet Colorado town of Frederick, after murdering his family, Chris Watts calculatingly and coldly put his girls in oil battery tanks and buried his pregnant wife in a shallow grave, then returned to work like nothing happened.</p><br> <br> <p>Chris ultimately pled guilty to the murders, and he is currently serving multiple life sentences.

And everyone, finally, was welcome--to come as themselves. This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco-sensation Sylvester was the piper.</p><p>Yale-trained sociologist Joshua Gamson uses Sylvester's life to lead us through the story of the 1970s, when a generation took off its shame. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle in this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.</p></p><p><p><b>Joshua Gamson</b> teaches at the University of San Francisco. He is the author of <i>Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity</i> and <i>Claims to Fame: Celebrity in Contemporary America</i>. He lives in Oakland, California.</p>In the world of that most disparaged of musical genres&#x2014;disco&#x2014;the subject of this biography commanded respect. By conventional standards, Sylvester James was an outsider&#x2014;he was an out, gay, African-American who dressed in drag and sang with a thundering falsetto&#x2014;but he found mainstream success in the late 1970s and early '80s with three Top 40 hits, <i>Dance (Disco Heat), You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)</i> and <i>I Who Have Nothing</i>, and an international #1 sensation (<i>Do Ya Wanna Funk</i>). At times, Gamson's (<i>Freaks Talk Back</i>) extensively researched volume is a vibrant and moving oral biography, with firsthand conversations with virtually everyone who knew or worked with Sylvester, from his youth in South Central L.A. through his successful music career, to his death from AIDS in 1988 at 41. The richness of this material (Sylvester's background singers Martha Wash and Izora Rhodes Armstead, who later became the Weather Girls, are particularly amusing and insightful raconteurs) reveals all the shadings of Sylvester's diva persona: he was fierce but generous, caustic but caring, temperamental but talented. Gamson's pulsating use of song lyrics, sounds and descriptions also creates a tangible history of San Francisco as it changed from a joyous oasis of liberation to the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic. Seventeen years after his death, this gay icon gets the celebratory biography he deserves. Photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tlass pushed for conciliation but Assad decided to crush the uprising -- an act which would catapult the country into an eight-year long war, killing almost half a million and fueling terrorism and a global refugee crisis.<br><br><i>Assad or We Burn the Country</i> examines Syria's tragedy through the generational saga of the Assad and Tlass families, once deeply intertwined and now estranged in Bashar's bloody quest to preserve his father's inheritance. By drawing on his own reporting experience in Damascus and exclusive interviews with Tlass, Dagher takes readers within palace walls to reveal the family behind the destruction of a country and the chaos of an entire region.<br><br>Dagher shows how one of the world's most vicious police states came to be and explains how a regional conflict extended globally, engulfing the Middle East and pitting the United States and Russia against one another. <br><br>Timely, propulsive, and expertly reported, <i>Assad or We Burn the Country</i> is the definitive account of this global crisis, going far beyond the news story that has dominated headlines for years.</p><p>Sam Dagher has reported in the Middle East for more than fifteen years, most recently for <i>The Atlantic</i>. He was the only non-Syrian reporter for a major Western media outlet based in Damascus from 2012 to 2014, a period during which he was arrested by a pro Assad militia and briefly held in an underground <i>mukhabarat </i>(secret police) prison. He was later expelled from Syria for reporting deemed unfavorable to the regime. He has worked for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>, and <i>Agence France Presse</i>, and has covered the conflict in Iraq, the Arab Spring uprisings, and Libya. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> nominated Dagher's work from Syria for the Pulitzer Prize and other journalism awards."A vivid and powerful account of the roots and course of the conflict, setting it in the context of Assad's personal history and approach to power."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Washington Post</i></i></b><br><br><strong>A <em>New York Times Book Review</em> Editor's Choice Pick</strong><br><br>"Dagher draws on history, interviews and his own experience as a reporter in Syria to depict an utterly ruthless regime."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Editor's Choice</i></b><br><br>"[An] impressively detailed account"&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Guardian US</i></i></b><br><br>"Sam Dagher's book <i>Assad or We Burn the Country </i>is a vivid and at times gruelling account of the suppression of the Syrian resistance...It is a powerful testimony of a war correspondent for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. His account carries the outrage and passion of a witness to atrocity."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Financial Times </i></i></b><br><br>"He was briefly held by pro-regime militiamen in an underground prison and was summarily expelled by the Mukhabarat in 2014. This gives his description of events a credibility lacking in many other accounts."&#x2015;<b><i>Patrick Cockburn, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"An important addition to the existing literature on the Middle East - especially Syria - by an astute Middle East watcher...It is absolutely indispensable to understand current Middle Eastern and Syrian situation."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Washington Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"As with so much of Dagher's writing, what's striking about the book is it doesn't just confirm the worst that's been reported about Assad's regime in the much-maligned "mainstream media;" it unearths new ways in which the horror and criminality are in fact more terrible than previously understood."&#x2015;<b><i>Alex Rowell, <em>Al-Jumhuriya</em></i></b><br><br>"Drawing on years of reporting and interviews with those at the top of the Syrian regime, Sam Dagher's book is one that readers won't be able to put down."&#x2015;<b><i>Kerry Breen, <em>TODAY Show </em></i></b><br><br>"As the only Western reporter based in Damascus during the early years of the civil war, Dagher has a rich perspective on the inner machinations of the regime of Bashar al Assad. In this important book, he lays out in grim detail the staggering cynicism and ruthless brutality of the Assad family. In doing so, he provides readers with a timely description of the dynasty that precipitated the destruction of a nation."&#x2015;<b><i>Clarissa Ward, Chief International Correspondent, <i>CNN International</i></i></b></p><h2>So You Want to Start a Brewery?: The Lagunitas Story</h2><p><p>In 1993, Tony Magee, who had foundered at every job he&#x2019;d ever had, decided to become the founder of a brewery. <i>So You Want to Start a Brewery?</i> is the thrilling first-person account of his gut-wrenching challenges and unexpected successes. </p><p>Based in Petaluma, California, the Lagunitas Brewing Company makes craft beer that is simple and flavorful and defies categorization.

He came to America with a fresh eye when it was still possible to document some of our unspoiled wilderness. He was also, during his lifetime, witness to the rapid changes that were taking place. Audubon&#x2019;s real contribution was not the conservation ethic but awareness. That in itself is enough; awareness inevitably leads to concern.<br> <br>Audubon&#x2019;s frequent references to the palatability of birds and their availability in the market make us realize how far we have come in bird protection, if not in our epicurean tastes. He wrote that "the Barred Owl was very often exposed for sale in the New Orleans market; the Creoles make Gumbo of it, and pronounce the flesh palatable." Not only does he speak with a gourmets authority about the edibility of owls, loons, cormorants, and crows, but also the gustatory delights of juncos, white throated sparrows, and robins.<br> <br>It may seem paradoxical that this prototype of the woodsman huntsman should have become the father figure of the conservation movement in North America. Like most other pioneer ornithologists, he was literally "in blood up to his elbows." He seemed obsessed with shooting; far more birds fell to his gun than he needed for drawing or research or for food. He once said that it was not a really good day unless he shot a hundred birds. But in his later writings, when recounting old shooting forays, there is a note of regret, as though his conscience were bothering him about the excesses of his trigger happy days. He deplored the slaughter, especially when perpetrated by others a double standard, if you will. But only once did he ask forgiveness for his acts. After describing the carnage that took place in the Florida Keys when he and his party landed in a colony of cormorants, "committing frightful havoc among them," he wrote: "You must try to excuse these murders, which in truth might not have been so numerous had I not thought of you [the reader] quite as often while on the Florida Keys, with the burning sun over my head and my body oozing at every pore, as I do now while peaceably scratching my paper with an iron pen, in one of the comfortable and quite cool houses of Old Scotland."<br> <br>Repeatedly in his writings he reveals this dual nature, or inner conflict. After finding the nest of a pair of least sandpipers he wrote, "I was truly sorry to rob them of their eggs, although impelled to do so by the love of science, which offers a convenient excuse for even worse acts." Again, when he first met the arctic tern in the Magdalene Islands: "As I admired its easy and graceful motions, I felt agitated with a desire to possess it. Our guns were accordingly charged with mustard seed shot, and one after another you might have seen the gentle birds come whirling down upon the waters Alas, poor things! How well do I remember the pain it gave me, to be thus obliged to pass and execute sentence upon them. At that very moment I thought of those long past times when individuals of my own species were similarly treated; but I excused myself with plea of necessity, as I recharged my double gun." Another example of Audubon&#x2019;s compulsion to shoot.<br> <br>In light of his record it would seem inappropriate that one of the foremost conservation organizations in the United States should adopt Audubon&#x2019;s name, but not so. He was ahead of his time. Like so many thoughtful sportsmen since, he eventually developed a conservation conscience. In an era when there were no game laws, no national parks or refuges, when there was no environmental ethic, when vulnerable nature gave way to human pressures and often sheer stupidity, he was a witness who sounded the alarm. He became more and more concerned during his later travels when, with the perspective of his years, he could see the trend. He noticed that prairie chickens, wild turkeys, Carolina parakeets, and many other birds were no longer as numerous as he once knew them. He wrote vividly and passionately about what he saw. He pondered the future, and some of the passages in his writing were prophetic.<br> <br>Audubon could not have known that because of his artistry and his writing his name would become a household word, synonymous with birds, wildlife, and conservation. The National Audubon Society, formerly known as the National Association of Audubon Societies, was launched in the early years of this century, when no one spoke of "ecology" or "environment." It was primarily a bird organization at first. Over the years the Society has gone through a philosophical metamorphosis. Bird-watching was the precursor of ecological awareness, and "Audubon" has become a symbol of the environmental movement.<br> <br>John James Audubon received high honors during the two decades prior to his death in 1851, but his greatest fame came in the century that followed. He had sparked a latent nationwide interest in the natural world, especially its birds, and his name became enshrined in hundreds of streets, towns, and parks across the land. Even a mountain peak in the Rockies is named in his honor. In the section of New York City where he lived there is an Audubon Avenue, an Audubon Theatre, and, now translated into digits, an Audubon telephone exchange. There was even a group that called themselves the "Audubon Artists," although they did not draw birds. But the greatest monument to his name is the National Audubon Society, which, unlike the "Audubon gun clubs" before the turn of the century, reflects the other side of John James Audubon, the passionate concern for the survival of wildlife and wild America that he developed as he grew older.<br> <br>The Audubon Saga<br> <br>The saga of Audubon has been told many times, with variations. It is not exactly a Horatio Alger tale of rags to riches, because the fledgling Audubon, born out of wedlock, was given a young gentleman&#x2019;s tutoring and was all but spoiled by an indulgent stepmother.<br> <br>Jean Jacques Foug�re Audubon was born in 1785 on the island of Santo Domingo, now Haiti, in the West Indies. He was the son of an enterprising French sea captain who, after reverses in Les Cayes, where he owned property, returned to France with the boy. His mother was a young lady, Mademoiselle Rabin, originally from Nantes, who died before the captain returned to his home and legal wife in France. How he explained his transgressions to Madame Audubon is not known, but she took the four year old boy to her heart as her own as she did his sister, also born out of wedlock.<br> <br>Perhaps to enable his son to escape conscription in Napoleon&#x2019;s army, or perhaps to help him avoid the stigma of illegitimacy, Captain Audubon sent Jean Jacques at the age of eighteen to Mill Grove near Philadelphia where he owned property. The birds of America fascinated young Audubon, and drawing them became an obsession from which he never freed himself.<br> <br>Audubon performed an experiment at Mill Grove that marked a "first" in the history of ornithology. He was fascinated by the phoebes that lived along the creek near his home. By placing silver threads about the legs of a brood of young phoebes to see whether they would return the following year, he became the first bird bander (or "ringer," to use the British term).<br> <br>At Mill Grove Audubon married Lucy Bakewell, the daughter of a neighbor. Shortly thereafter the young couple moved westward to Louisville, Kentucky, where Jean Jacques&#x2019;s father had set him up in business. But business was not in his blood, or so it seemed. It must be admitted that times were uncertain and investment risky on the frontier in those days. Moving farther west to the Mississippi and then down to New Orleans, Audubon met successive reverses until he was almost reduced to penury. Some called him impractical.<br> <br>In reviewing this difficult period Audubon wrote, "Birds were then as now I drew, I looked on nature only; my days were happy beyond human conception." He had conceived a grandiose plan of painting all the birds of North America at least all then known and at no time did he lose sight of this goal. He may have harbored the idea of eventual publication from the start, but it seems that the unheralded visit by pioneer ornithologist Alexander Wilson stirred his competitive spirit to action.<br> <br>Audubon was often away from his family for months, exploring the wilderness, painting, and pursuing his dream. His devoted Lucy, who had borne him two sons, Victor and John, kept home and hearth together by teaching. He himself eked out a living as an itinerant portrait painter and as a dancing and fencing instructor.<br> <br>As his portfolio bulged he began to look for a patron or a publisher, but he could find none in New York or Philadelphia. No one would risk the capital in those difficult days. Audubon decided that there might be a better chance of success in England, so with Lucy&#x2019;s savings as a teacher and some money he had managed to acquire by painting portraits of well to do people, he set sail in 1826.<br> <br>Abroad he was acclaimed immediately. Although he had been a nobody on his home turf, the rough, colorful man from the American frontier was a sensation abroad. He fascinated the genteel patrons of the art salons in London, Edinburgh, and Paris. Madison Avenue would have admired his public relations techniques. Long ahead of his time in the art of showmanship, he played his part well. To fit the image of the American woodsman, he wore buckskin and allowed his hair to grow long over his shoulders. The former bankrupt businessman became a super salesman, traveling from city to city to secure subscriptions. Meanwhile, as a sort of production manager, he monitored with infinite care the work of the engravers and a corps of colorists. He was not only artist, author, and scientist but also publisher, business manager, treasurer, and bill collector.<br> <br>How could he have been "irresponsible" or "impractical" if he could do all this?<br> <br>William Lizars of Edinburgh agreed to engrave and publish his work, but when only ten plates had been finished the colorists went on strike and Audubon was forced to find another engraver. This was Robert Havell, Jr., of London. Audubon was fortunate to be in the hands of such a skilled craftsman and artist. Havell&#x2019;s accomplishment in etching the copper plates was as much a tour de force as the original paintings. It is instructive to compare the watercolors that hang in the galleries of the New York Historical Society to the Havell prints with which most of us are familiar.<br> <br>In his 435 colorplates, Audubon depicted the birds exactly the size they were in life. Even the oversize format, 29 1/2 by 39 1/2 inches (known as "double elephant folio"), the largest ever attempted up to then in the history of book publishing, was insufficient to accommodate the largest birds comfortably. Tall birds, such as the flamingo and the great blue heron, were fitted in by drooping their long necks toward their feet. On the other hand, tiny birds, such as kinglets and hummingbirds, are all but lost on the page.<br> <br>Among the last few plates in the Elephant Folio and the 65 additional ones in the smaller octavo edition, Audubon included a number of birds from the western part of the country. These were his least successful efforts, probably because he had not seen these species in life.<br> <br>Audubon as an Artist<br> <br>Audubon implied that as a youth he had studied under the French master Jacques Louis David, and in doing so laid the foundation of his ability to draw. However, recent research has disputed this. Perhaps it was a good thing that his art was truly his own; like many another innovative genius he was not a clone of his professor. Nor were his paintings like the dull, documentary drawings of Alexander Wilson and his other contemporaries.<br> <br>The thing that separated Audubon from his predecessors was that he was the first to give his birds the simulation of life. The others portrayed them stiffly and archaically as though they were on museum pedestals. To invest his birds with vitality and movement, Audubon worked from freshly killed specimens, wiring them into lifelike positions. In his youth he had tried hundreds of outline sketches but found it difficult to finish them. He fashioned a wooden model, "a tolerable-looking Dodo I gave it a kick, broke it to atoms, walked off, and thought again." It was then that he conceived the procedure he was to follow for many years. He wrote: "One morning I leapt out of bed went to the river, took a bath and returning to town inquired for wire of different sizes, bought some and was soon again at Mill Grove. I shot the first Kingfisher I met, pierced the body with wire, fixed it to the board, another wire held the head, smaller ones fixed the feet There stood before me the real Kingfisher. I outlined the bird, colored it. This was my first drawing actually from nature."<br> <br>It has been remarked that a Fuertes bird in repose has more the essence of the living bird than an Audubon bird vividly animated. This is understandable when one keeps in mind that Audubon wired up his specimens, and they sometimes looked it. In most cases this method worked fairly well, but the wild turkey cock, wired with its head looking over its back so as to fit the sheet, is almost a caricature. So are Audubon&#x2019;s barred owl with the grinning squirrel and his two red tailed hawks quarreling in mid air for possession of a rabbit. His golden eagle frozen in flight with a hare, his two barn owls at night, and his squabbling caracaras are all too contrived. His two blue winged teals look as though they were thrown through the air like footballs. Inasmuch as Audubon did not know some of the pelagic birds the fulmar, greater shearwater, and tropic bird on their nesting ground, he showed them standing on their toes rather than resting on their bellies with their tarsi flat on the ground.<br> <br>We can if we choose, be critical of these errors, but the wildlife artist of today is able to step on the shoulders of those who have gone before. In fairness, Audubon made the great leap forward at a time when most birds were drawn as though "stuffed" and fastened to wooden perches in museum cases. He took birds out of the glass case for all time and gave them a semblance of life. His paintings have a dramatic impact seldom equaled by those of his successors.<br> <br>Louis Agassiz Fuertes, in a remarkable letter to his young prot�g� George Miksch Sutton, extolled Audubon&#x2019;s strengths and defended his shortcomings, unaware that his "training under David" was apparently a myth.<br> <br>"Say what you will of Audubon, he was the first and only man whose bird drawings showed the faintest hint of anatomical study, or that the fresh bird was in hand when the work was done, and is so immeasurably ahead of anything, up to his time or since, until the modern idea of drawing endlessly from life began to bear fruit, that its strength deserves all praise and honor, and its many weaknesses condonement, as they were the fruit of his training; stilted, tight, and unimaginative old [Jacques Louis] David sticks out in the stiff landscape, the hard outline, and the dull, lifeless shading, while the overpowering virility of Audubon is shown in the snappy, instantaneous attitudes, and dashing motion of his subjects. While theres much to criticize there is also much to learn, and much to admire, in studying the monumental classic that he left behind him. He made many errors, but he also left a living record that has been of inestimable value and stimulus to students, and made an everlasting mark in American ornithology. It is indeed hard to imagine what the science would be like in this country and what the state ...</p><h2>Nuevo Testamento, Versi�n Recobro (edici�n econ�mica; negro; con notas) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Based on 26th edition of Nestle-Aland Greek text <br> Literal yet readable <br> Extensive footnotes <br> Study notes <br> Outline at beginning of each book <br> Cross-references <br> Semi-Overlapping Cover <br> Gold Edging <br> 4 7/8 X 7 % Font size: 11</p><p></p><h2>Lend Me a Tenor</h2><p>Comedy / 4m, 4f / Int.

From Churchill's youth as a poor student to his leadership during World War II, Keegan reveals a man whose own idea of an English past&#x2014;eloquently embodied in his speeches&#x2014;allowed him to exhort a nation to unprecedented levels of sacrifice. The result is a uniquely discerning look at one of the most fascinating personalities in history.<br><br>&#x201c;The best military historian of our generation.&#x201d; &#x2013;Tom Clancy</p><p>He was something of a bully, something of a blowhard, without friends and always in search of a sympathetic audience for his monologues. Yet, writes John Keegan in this slender but thorough portrait, Winston Churchill was unquestionably the right man for the time.<p> Few biographers are better equipped than Keegan, the eminent military historian, to write of Churchill as a wartime leader. Indeed, Keegan suggests, Churchill was never more at ease than when confronting some fierce enemy, whether across the English Channel or a range of Afghan hills; it was from the saddle that he developed his "vision of how an enlightened empire might transform the future of mankind." The rise of other, less enlightened empires helped put an end to his own, but Churchill steadfastly insisted on a strong role for Great Britain in the postwar world--in which he succeeded, even if voters turned him out of office almost as soon as the war ended.</p><p> Keegan's respectful portrait assesses Churchill's many accomplishments (and a few noteworthy failures) as he sought, in Churchill's ringing words, to "resist oppression, to protect the weak, to vindicate the profound but unwritten Law of Nations." Admirers of Churchill and students of his time will find much of value in these pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p><b>Sir John Desmond Patrick Keegan (</b>1934&#x2013;2012), was one of the most distinguished contemporary military historians and was for many years the senior lecturer at Sandhurst (the British Royal Military Academy) and the defense editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London).

Starting with the Garden of Eden and ending in a Mars colony, the stories wrestle with conflicts of idealism and practicality, communal ambition and individual kink. Stories jump between genres&#x2014;from historical fiction to science fiction, realism to fabulism&#x2014;but all ask that fundamental human question: is paradise really so impossible?<br> <br> Over the course of twelve stories, Hyde writes with a mix of lyricism, humor, and masterful detail. A group of environmental missionaries seeks to start an ideal eco-society on an island in The Bahamas, only to unwittingly tyrannize the local inhabitants.

Haunted by her years at a collegiate idyll, a young woman eulogizes a friendship. After indenturing his only son to the Shakers, an antebellum vegan turns to Louisa May Alcott&#x2019;s famous family for help.

Starting with a married couple expelled from a certain unnamed garden, the collection charts the journeys of assorted outcasts, drifters, hippies, and astronauts as they set out to find their personal utopias, whether at an &#x2018;eco-revolution&#x2019; boot camp in the Bahamas, a Shaker community in nineteenth-century America, or a colony on Mars. In stories that range fearlessly across space, time, and genre, Allegra Hyde keeps pursuing new variations on the collection&#x2019;s major theme. The result is an ambitious and memorable debut, in which a dozen different characters, looking for a dozen different paradises, all end up learning some customized version of that ultimate Miltonic lesson: &#x2018;the mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Bennett Sims, 2016 judge, 2016 John Simmons Short Fiction Award<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Of This New World</i>&nbsp;is the right title for a collection that&#x2019;s so witheringly deadpan and compassionate about who we are now.

Whether these utopian yearnings are miscarried into outer space, nearly extinguished by the stringent rules of a nineteenth-century Shaker community, or demoralized by an eco-experiment on an&nbsp;island named after&nbsp;the Greek word for freedom<i>,</i>&nbsp;each fragile, idealized construct shares a common hope for harmony, as well as a doomed instinct to replace the anxiety of existence with an illusion of immaculate form.&#x201d;&#x2014;Melissa Pritchard, author,&nbsp;<i>Palmerino</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Solemn Pleasure: To Imagine, Witness, and Write</i><br><br>&#x201c;Allegra Hyde is a talented ventriloquist, gifting each of her stories its own compelling voice,&nbsp;full of history and science, myth and folklore, humor and heart.

Whether for morning or evening devotions or other fixed-time prayers, such spiritual respites were deemed essential to worshiping God. Over the years, Christians developed a structure for such moments of worship, keyed to the time of day and season of the year. Part of its genius was the seamless integration of Scripture and prayer. This ancient practice, called the "Daily Office," has experienced a resurgence of use in our time.<br><br><em>Seeking God's Face</em> is a user-friendly approach to this form of prayer and devotion. Each office includes a psalm of praise, a passage of Scripture, and a brief set of prayers. An introduction to prayer-book use from Eugene Peterson is included to acclimate readers to this form.</p><p>Phil Reinders is the Senior Minister of the Knox Presbyterian Church in Toronto, where he lives with his wife, Betty, and his children, Owen and Lily. Some of Phil&#39;s more transcendent moments have involved most anything in the mountains, listening to great music, fine wine, good movies, strong coffee and even better books. He loves the creative process of writing and photography."Inspired in every sense of that word and masterfully compiled, Seeking God's Face is a prayer book always and everywhere to be treasured. From our very beginnings, we have understood that fixed daily prayer is just as necessary to the fully realized Christian life as water and food are to the body's sustenance. The problem for many Christians up to now--and especially for those from Reformed branches of the faith--has been the lack of prayer tools and prayer books that accord with their communal traditions. Now, in this one volume, Philip Reinders gives the church not only a solution to that problem but also a God-drenched prayer tool suitable for all of us."; --Phyllis Tickle, compiler, <em>The Words of Jesus --A Gospel of the Sayings of Our Lord</em></p><h2>Soap Carving: For Children of All Ages (Schiffer Book for Woodcarvers)</h2><p>When first invited to give talks and demonstrations on carving techniques to school children, Howard K. Suzuki quickly found out that wood was not the most suitable medium. It took too long to show much progress in the limited time available. He decided to use bars of soap to demonstrate basic techniques on carving and sculpturing. Soap is an inexpensive and very desirable carving medium. Soon demonstrations developed into hands-on experiences for his students. In this book, Dr. Suzuki describes and illustrates with color photographs how to make safe and simple wooden carving tools. He demonstrates basic soap-carving techniques using several stepwise how-to examples, from a simple heart to a more complex turtle. Dr. Suzuki integrates art and science into his instructions and combines them to produce a super learning experience for children (of all ages) who do learn to carve through his methods.</p><p>Dr. Howard K. Suzuki is a biologist living in Florida. He has written many books on soap carving with Schiffer Publishing,</p><h2>Healing the Heart &amp; Soul: A Five-Step, Soul-Level Healing Process for Transforming Your Life</h2><p>This book contains an invaluable secret-a process that leads to deeper healing than most people have ever experienced or dreamed possible.<br> <br>Healing the Heart &amp; Soul offers the essential ingredients for personal, life transformation, as well as providing a deeper understanding as to why some people don't seem to heal. It also covers the roles of forgiveness, mirroring, and miracles in relation to healing. Then it shares the specific technique of the five-step, Soul-Level Healing Process that will, in nearly every case, uncover the "real" cause (or causes) hidden behind any particular challenge or problem (physical, emotional, mental, financial, and even within relationships), thus making room for true transformation and healing. Soul-Level Healing can be defined as "a two-part process of Emptying one's cup of faulty belief systems AND Refilling this cup with new, healthy, and loving belief systems."</p><p></p><h2>Reclaiming Your Story: Family History and Spiritual Growth</h2><p><p>Merle Jordan argues that many people spend their adult lives struggling to distinguish between the imperatives of divine authority and the deeply rooted psychological authority of family structures.

There was no mention of any severe weather. By the time oceanfront residents noticed an ominous color in the sky, it was too late to escape. In an age before warning systems and the ubiquity of television, this unprecedented storm caught the Northeast off guard, obliterated coastal communities, and killed seven hundred people.<br><br><i>The Great Hurricane: 1938</i> is a spellbinding hour-by-hour reconstruction of one of the most destructive and powerful storms ever to hit the United States. With riveting detail, Burns weaves together the countless personal stories of loved ones lost and lives changed forever &#x2014; from those of the Moore family, washed to sea on a raft formerly their attic floor, to Katharine Hepburn, holed up in her Connecticut mansion, watching her car take to the air like a bit of paper.<br></p><p><p><strong>Cherie Burns</strong> is a writer whose work has appeared in the <em>New York Times, People, Glamour, US, New York</em>, and other publications. This is her second book.</p>Post-Hurricane Katrina, Burns' meticulously researched account of a hurricane that devastated the New England coast hits home even more than it would have before. Fields' reading is perfectly tuned to the way the tragedy unfolded, so while there are no sound effects or other extras, the modulations in her voice provide tension and emotion to spare. Burns uncovered myriad personal stories about the experience, and as Fields relates the struggles of one individual after another during the day it struck, the listener is caught up intimately in the drama. Fields does an excellent job of highlighting, with notes of amazement, New Englanders' initial response to the storm-some were pleased at the excitement, and many were so unworried that they carried on stubbornly with their plans for weddings and picnics-but she also inflects her voice with appropriate dark foreboding. As Burns builds up a background for understanding the storm's effect, listeners may be bored by the long but somewhat generic descriptions of 1930s American life. Fortunately, any such feelings are more than countered by the minute details she has gathered of people's actions before and during the hurricane, which create a vivid picture in the listener's mind and make it feel all the more tragic to hear about the unprecedented havoc wrought by the wind and rain. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Beyond Valor,</i> Patrick O'Donnell, a pioneer of Internet-based &#x201c;oral history&#x201d; who has collected the first-person stories of hundreds of veterans on his online oral history project, re-creates the frontline experience in stunning detail, weaving together more than 650 &#x201c;e-histories&#x201d; and interviews into a seamless narrative.<br> <br>In recollections filled with pain, poignancy, and pride, veterans chronicle the destruction of entire battalions, speak of their own personal scars, and pay tribute to their fallen colleagues. <i>Beyond Valor</i> brings to light the hidden horrors and uncelebrated heroics of a war fought by a now-vanishing generation and preserves them for all future generations.</p><p>The success of Tom Brokaw's <i>Greatest Generation</i> has sparked a renewed interest in books about World War II and the people who fought in it. Patrick K. O'Donnell maintains, however, that behind those official histories and carefully crafted memoirs lies a "hidden war"--"a bottled up, buried version shielded even from family members because many of the memories are too painful to discuss." In <i>Beyond Valor</i>, O'Donnell brings this hidden war to the surface, allowing men from the elite forces to tell their own stories, thus creating a fascinating combat history of WWII.<p> O'Donnell introduces readers to some of the greatest of the greatest generation--men such as Robert Kinney of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, wounded by a mortar at Anzio ("it tore my fanny open, took a big chunk of meat out of there--I could afford that"). While in the hospital, wounded members of the regiment were asked by one of their officers to return to the front: </p><blockquote>We all went down, about forty of us in casts, bandages, arms in slings and everything. He said, "Your buddies up there are catching hell and we've got to go back if we can. You don't have to, we're not going to order you, but we're looking for volunteers." We said, "Hell, we'll go." We had just the best-spirited bunch of scrappers you ever saw.</blockquote> There are also stories about compassion in the midst of carnage. Albert Hassenzahl of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was seriously injured on a drop during the Normandy invasion. While waiting to be rescued, the wind blew his blanket off him. A man on an adjacent stretcher reached over and carefully tucked the blanket in around Hassenzahl. The other man was a German POW. "I didn't say a word to him, but I was able to move my head a little and looked over at him ... neither of us said a word, but mentally I might have said 'thank you' with my eyes and he might have said 'you're welcome' with his."<p> Though it will certainly appeal to them, O'Donnell insists that <i>Beyond Valor</i> is not aimed at war buffs--it's for the soldiers themselves. "My work has been one of preservation, done in gratitude for a generation that sacrificed so much." By sharing these stories, O'Donnell has helped to preserve and honor their memory. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>[An] Extraordinary book.

Derek Blanchard&#x2019;s car eased into the faculty parking lot while precipitation poured down across the University of Pennsylvania. A few students were hurrying through the storm. Otherwise, the campus looked empty. Derek pulled on his raincoat, tugged the hood into place, grabbed his briefcase, and got out of the car.<br> <br>Ten minutes later he was seated at a table in the Gateman Conference Room with a half dozen doctoral candidates. He was an African American, tall, with a close resemblance to Hollywood star Alan Parkman, and a baritone voice that people took seriously. Guessing ages during an era when almost no one looked more than thirty was tricky, but most of his students had done the research, so they knew he&#x2019;d been around a long time.<br> <br>They were discussing theses. Each was targeted on aspects of stellar evolution. Derek outlined the requirements for a reasonable analysis, laid out the time limits, and went over other technical details. The candidates, three men and three women, submitted their topics. Derek supported some, recommended a completely different approach for two, and added a few general suggestions. It was hard to keep focused because of what was coming next.<br> <br>When they&#x2019;d finished, he closed his notebook. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;For anyone who&#x2019;s free, we&#x2019;ll have access to the Van Entel this morning from eleven fifteen to twelve thirty.&#x201d; The Van Entel was the supertelescope, which was in solar orbit. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll not only be able to look through it, but we&#x2019;ll be controlling it. If you&#x2019;d like to sit in, stop by the Data Collection Center. But come early. And I&#x2019;m sorry about the last-minute notification, but none of us saw this coming.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek was an astronomer, a physicist, a mathematician, and a WSA consultant. The latter gave him a few benefits, like the Van Entel, which he enjoyed passing on to his students. He was also a frequent guest speaker at scientific conferences. When he got in front of a microphone and looked out across an audience, he almost changed character. No one would ever have called him reserved, but he was not inclined to take over a conversation. On stage, however, he held his listeners&#x2019; attention, provoked laughter, and enjoyed himself immensely.<br> <br>Of the students, Karen Blum had probably the most potential. She showed serious analytical capabilities, she was ambitious, and she had an IQ that topped 160. She followed him out of the room. &#x201c;Professor Blanchard,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;may I ask what project you&#x2019;ll be working on? With the Van Entel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a specific project, Karen,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You might think of me more as an eavesdropper. They&#x2019;ll be looking out at the Kellerman Cluster today. At some stars nobody&#x2019;s ever paid much attention to. They&#x2019;re trying to get them cataloged.&#x201d;<br> <br>Karen literally hugged herself. &#x201c;How far are they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven thousand light-years. Give or take.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful. Is there anything special about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really. Actually, they&#x2019;re not so much interested in the stars as they are in the telescope. It&#x2019;s still in its testing phase.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes, of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be using the Hynds as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The ultra-radiotelescope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. It&#x2019;s in orbit too, and it&#x2019;s also aimed at the area. We&#x2019;d like to see what else we can learn about what&#x2019;s going on out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes brightened. &#x201c;You planning on taking a trip to the area anytime soon?&#x201d;<br> <br>That was a reference to Derek&#x2019;s background, which consisted of several interstellar missions. That was one of the reasons he retained his situation with the World Space Authority while simultaneously teaching at Penn. &#x201c;Maybe next week,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a joke, right? They&#x2019;re closing down the interstellar flights, aren&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If we let them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think the Centauri Initiative will really pass?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Karen&#x2019;s amicable expression turned hostile. &#x201c;Why do those idiots worry so much about alien invasions? There probably aren&#x2019;t any aliens who would be interested in bothering us. There are hardly any aliens at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>He managed a pained smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an election year.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The Data Collection Center was almost filled when he arrived twenty minutes early. Linda DuBreuil, the director, was standing guard by the group of seats reserved for the faculty. They were in front of the main screen. An additional eighty chairs were there to accommodate students and a few instructors not connected with the astronomy department. They were filling up as he walked in. The event had gotten coverage in the media, and he expected it to be picked up by the Science Channel.<br> <br>Linda saw him and got out of her chair. &#x201c;Hello, Derek. You ready to go?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d; He loved each new development in telescopes. Loved being part of the process, even when he was merely serving as a PR guy.<br> <br>They sat down and she handed him a microphone and an ear pod. &#x201c;You want to do the intro?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda had a smile that could light up the entire room. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your party, Derek.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good enough.&#x201d; He put the pod in his right ear so he could hear Ben, the AI, and turned the microphone on. &#x201c;Ben, you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here, Professor. We&#x2019;re on schedule.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda looked to their right, where a couple of people he didn&#x2019;t know were getting seated with the science faculty. &#x201c;We have some media,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>The center filled and they had to bring in extra chairs, and finally just leave the doors open for any who wanted to stand in the rear. At five after eleven Derek got to his feet, turned to face the audience, and made some introductory comments about the Kellerman Cluster and the capabilities of the Van Entel. He was almost finished when Ben cut in. &#x201c;Professor, we&#x2019;ve received another alert from the Coordination Office.&#x201d; The Coordination Office was located on the Union Space Station. &#x201c;Control system will be transferred to us in one minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, we&#x2019;re apparently ready to go.&#x201d; Derek lowered his voice. &#x201c;Okay, Ben. Activate the display.&#x201d; The screen lit up, as did a couple of smaller displays around the room. Derek looked out over his audience. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be handling the operation from here. You&#x2019;ll notice, incidentally, when we tell the control system what to do, there&#x2019;ll be a delay before it responds. You know why that is, of course?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hands went up all over the room. Everybody knew the Van Entel was approximately five million kilometers away, so the radio signal would need about eighteen seconds to reach it. And consequently thirty-six seconds before there could be a response.<br> <br>One of his students, Bobby Dexter, raised his hand. &#x201c;Really? Only half a minute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty close right now, Bobby. Sometimes the process would take close to a half hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>The screen filled with stars, two the size of small coins, the others no more than distant glimmers in the night. &#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; Derek said, &#x201c;you know the target system. Take us to it, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Transmission on its way. Hynds also activated.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek did a mental countdown. He reached nineteen before the stars began to move. From right to left, across the screen. The two coins slipped off the side of the screen. People were shifting in their seats behind him. He&#x2019;d gotten so excited, he&#x2019;d lost track of the fact he was still on his feet, blocking everyone&#x2019;s view. He didn&#x2019;t want to sit down, so he moved to the side of the room where he was out of the way.<br> <br>Derek loved this part of his profession, inflaming the passions of students. There might be another Polcrest or Sagan in the room. Somebody who&#x2019;d lead the charge against the politicians who were trying to wreck everything humans had accomplished in space over the past three centuries. We&#x2019;ve been down this road before, damn it. Went to the moon and forgot how to do it. And here we go again with people, including scientists, claiming that interstellar travel is too dangerous. That it should be stopped. We don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s out there. And it has gone to the heart of the current presidential campaign. We&#x2019;ve looked around the local area. But stop it there. Do not go west of Centauri. It had become a maxim for the Progressives.<br> <br>This wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d been present for a demonstration of the capabilities of a supertelescope, but having his hand on the wheel added a dimension he hadn&#x2019;t experienced in the past. He watched the stars drift by, saw a configuration that might have been a wrench, and knew where they were. More or less. The wrench reached the side and was gone, and he was lost again. But no surprises there.<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard,&#x201d; said the AI, &#x201c;Union advises we slow down so they can get the two telescopes in sync.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do it, Ben. And let&#x2019;s also increase magnification.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sky was still moving sidewise when a vast cloud of stars began to edge in on the right side. Students gasped. Somebody asked whether anyone living out there would ever see night. Derek was ecstatic.<br> <br>A young man seated a few rows back jumped out of his seat and started jabbing his finger at the display. A planet had appeared in the foreground.<br> <br>It was, Derek thought, a rogue world. But it was hard to be certain, and before he could get a good look, it had gone off the edge of the screen. The infamous thirty-six-second delay. Still more stars were going off the side. Damn. Well, forget the planet. They had bigger things to think about.<br> <br>He wanted the cluster in the center of the display, but it was already almost halfway across the screen before he stopped gaping and gave the order to stop the rotation.<br> <br>It continued to drift while he waited. Finally it stopped and they had a near-perfect perspective. It was spectacular. As breathtaking as anything he&#x2019;d ever seen. He would have liked to inform everyone what they were looking at. But he didn&#x2019;t know anything more about the specifics of the cluster than his students. That was an issue with the giant telescopes: He could spend a substantial amount of time tracing star patterns, constellations, whatever, but when the telescope zeroed in, the patterns tended to disappear. He was simply, like everyone else, staring at a sky full of stars. And if he did recognize a group of stars, it became rapidly irrelevant because there was just too much to look at. Pity. It would have been nice to be able to show off a bit.<br> <br>Ben&#x2019;s voice again: &#x201c;Derek, we are getting a signal from the Hynds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve picked up something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. It appears to be a telecast. From the edge of the cluster.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A telecast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is correct. Do you wish it placed on the display?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek had no idea what he expected. It would have to be a directional signal to make it this far. No standard telecast could come close to covering thousands of light-years. So it was probably what? A distress call? A mission report?<br> <br>Ben reduced the telescopic image to about a quarter of its size and moved it into a corner. Then he replaced it with a waterfall. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is the telecast.&#x201d;<br> <br>A waterfall?<br> <br>The audience froze and then broke into applause. Several wanted to know whether the system had gone off track somewhere. Linda reached over and grasped Derek&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s not Niagara.&#x201d;<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t an expansive waterfall, but it appeared to be extremely high, with water plummeting from a ridge deep into a canyon. He was just beginning to breathe normally again when he became aware of background music. It was a soft and gentle rhythm, in perfect harmony with the falling water.<br> <br>The applause faded and the room went silent, save for the music. Then suddenly everybody was talking. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard, what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda was looking at him and just shaking her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is that the signal that&#x2019;s coming in?&#x201d; He adjusted the microphone so everyone could hear the answer. &#x201c;Or have we picked up something local?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was forwarded by the Hynds unit. I have no way to determine its validity beyond that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It must be a transmission problem,&#x201d; said Karl Michaels, the science department chairman.<br> <br>He had to be right. The system had gotten screwed up. &#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; said Derek, as the noise level began to rise again, &#x201c;connect me with the Coordination unit.&#x201d;<br> <br>People in the audience were getting out of their chairs. &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be real.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s it coming from?&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman behind him seized his shoulder. &#x201c;Professor Blanchard, are we really seeing that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Michaels was on his feet, staring at the waterfall. &#x201c;Derek, any chance this is really happening?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything&#x2019;s possible, Karl.&#x201d;<br> <br>A male voice came in over the circuit. &#x201c;This is Coordination. You guys have a problem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you seen what&#x2019;s coming in through the Hynds?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d; He broke off. &#x201c;My God, that can&#x2019;t be right. Hold on.&#x201d; He broke away and Derek heard him talking in the background.<br> <br>The music played on. Derek&#x2019;s feet pressed against the floor in a subconscious effort to stop it.<br> <br>A woman&#x2019;s voice broke in. &#x201c;Give us a minute. We&#x2019;re checking on it now.&#x201d; Then she was talking to someone else: &#x201c;You have any idea where they are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek couldn&#x2019;t make out the response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor Blanchard. I can&#x2019;t explain this. We&#x2019;re not showing any technical issues.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Could you check it out? If you find anything, get back to me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. The techs are looking at it now.&#x201d;<br> <br>He signed off. &#x201c;Ben, can you lock in on the star that&#x2019;s closest to the source of this?&#x201d; Water was still spilling serenely over the edge while the music continued. &#x201c;Get me a catalog number.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For the star?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Working on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derek covered the microphone and tried to laugh everything off with his audience. &#x201c;One of the reasons astronomy is such a pleasure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You just never know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Ben was back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s KL37741.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What can you tell me about it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a class G yellow dwarf. Range is approximately 7,300 light-years.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can give you spectroscopic details if you want. But nothing about them stands out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can we get some additional magnification, Ben?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Negative. We are at maximum now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does it have a planet within the Goldilocks Zone?&#x201d; In the area that would allow liquid water to exist.<br> <br>He needed several minutes to respond to that. Finally, he was back. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too far to determine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Linda was staring at the display. She looked gloriously happy. &#x201c;Aliens?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Derek, did we just discover aliens? Who play music?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The reporters were waving, trying to get their attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need a planet,&#x201d; said Linda. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s out the...</p><h2>So Not Okay: An Honest Look at Bullying from the Bystander (Mean Girl Makeover)</h2><p><p><strong>There is no such thing as neutral.</strong></p><p>According to the Ambassadors 4 Kids Club, one out of every four students is bullied&#x2014;and 85% of these situations never receive intervention.

In 1898, a farmer in northwestern Minnesota unearthed a large stone engraved with what appeared to be Norse runes carved in 1362. Could medieval Scandinavians have penetrated deep into mainland North America over a century before Columbus discovered the New World? Does the stone provide evidence that forces a rewrite of American history, or was it merely a well-executed hoax? In the absence of written records documenting a Norse expedition into Minnesota, most historians have dismissed what became known as the Kensington Runestone as a hoax. However, Kehoe approaches the question holistically. She examines not only historical and literary evidence, but brings in data from archaeology, geology, linguistics, and biological anthropology. She concludes that the stone&#x2019;s authenticity should not be dismissed as readily as it has been so far, even if that means rethinking deeply ingrained ideas about contact between Europeans! and indigenous Americans.</p><p>Also by Alice Beck Kehoe and available from Waveland Press: Archaeology: A Concise Introduction (with Pleger) (ISBN 9781577664505); The Ghost Dance: Ethnohistory and Revitalization, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577664536); and Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking (ISBN 9781577661627).

Describing the problem of withdrawal from psychiatric drugs in detail, and providing clear advice regarding how to deal with this problem as Peter has done so well in this book, is long overdue. For decades, the belief system that is mainstream psychiatry has denied the existence of withdrawal problems from the substances they prescribe so widely. In reality, withdrawal problems with psychiatric drugs is a common occurrence. Because of psychiatry's reckless denial of this real and common problem, millions of people worldwide have not had the support and care they desperately need when attempting to come off psychiatric drugs, often been erroneously advised that these problems are confirmation of the existence of their supposed original so-called 'psychiatric illness.'

He describes the many dangers of psychiatric medication in straightforward research-based and contextually nuanced terms. Most helpfully, he articulates a method of empathic, person-centered psychotherapy as an alternative to the prevailing emotionally and system disengaged drug-centered approach. In this book, Dr. Breggin systematically outlines how to safely withdraw a patient from psychiatric medication with rich case examples drawn with the detail and sensitivity to individual and situational differences that reveal not only his extensive clinical experience, but his clear, knowledgeable, and compassionate vision of a more humane form of treatment. In this volume, Dr. Peter Breggin has again demonstrated that he is a model of what psychiatry can and should be.

Presuming a knowledge of basic calculus, the book first reviews the mathematical essentials required to master the materials to be presented. <br>The next four chapters take up linear equations, those of the first order and those with constant coefficients, variable coefficients, and regular singular points. The last two chapters address the existence and uniqueness of solutions to both first order equations and to systems and <i>n</i>-th order equations. <br>Throughout the book, the author carries the theory far enough to include the statements and proofs of the simpler existence and uniqueness theorems. Dr. Coddington, who has taught at MIT, Princeton, and UCLA, has included many exercises designed to develop the student's technique in solving equations.

The process begins with collecting baseline and background information about children, their everyday environments, and the other adults who work with them. Once IECSE teachers collect information, they can work in collaboration with other adults to plan intervention services that can be embedded into children's daily routines and activities. Throughout this chapter, we discuss how Heather, Maxi's IECSE teacher, uses this model to work with Maxi's teacher and mother to provide high-quality itinerant services. Chapter 10 continues this process by outlining the consultation and coaching process articulated earlier in this book. </p><p><b>Heather and Maxi</b></p><p><i>Maxi is 4 years old and loves going to preschool in Ms. Sherry's room</i>. She especially loves playing with her best friends Helene and Addison. Maxi has been enrolled in Ms. Sherry's room for the past 3 weeks, ever since her mom went back to work. A special school bus comes to pick Maxi up every morning to accommodate her wheelchair. Maxi has cerebral palsy, which has caused limited mobility. She uses a wheelchair to get around but is slowly learning to use a walker. In addition to having cerebral palsy, Maxi has difficulty attending to everyday activities. She is easily distracted, especially when it comes time for large- or small-group activities.<br><i>Heather is Maxi's IECSE teacher</i>. This is her fifth year providing itinerant services. She enjoys visiting other classrooms and says that she learns a lot by watching other teachers work with children. Although she started out providing direct services as an itinerant teacher, she is shifting toward more of a consultative approach. She visits Maxi's classrooms on Thursday mornings, usually from 9:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.<br><i>Sherry is Maxi's preschool teacher</i>. Sherry has an associate's degree in early childhood education and this is her 12th year teaching young children. She is enthusiastic and energetic and wants to do what is best for Maxi. With that said, Sherry has never worked with a child who has cerebral palsy and is very nervous. She wants to do what is best for Maxi but is afraid that she is going to do something wrong and has asked if her classroom is really the best place to meet Maxi's needs.<br><i>Megan is Maxi's mother</i>. She has just returned to work after staying at home with Maxi and her older sister for 5 years. She absolutely wants what is best for Maxi. In the past, Maxi has received special education and related services at home. The IECSE teacher would come to her home and work with Maxi on different skills. Megan also would bring Maxi to the physical and occupational therapists' offices on a regular basis. She knows that Heather's job really is to help Sherry work with Maxi, but she wants to make sure that Maxi receives all of the help she needs. She used to feel very confident that Maxi was getting the help she needed when the other itinerant teacher used to come to her home; and, although she likes Heather, she is not entirely sure that consultation is the way to go. </p><p><b>Gathering Information</b></p><p>Chapter 6 discussed the role of the IECSE teacher related to assessment&#x2014;formal and informal as well as assessment of children, adults, and environments. In addition, Chapter 4 described ways in which IECSE teachers gather information that can assist them in establishing a productive consultative relationship with other adults. To make appropriate decisions on behalf of children and families, IECSE teachers must know as much as possible about the child who is receiving itinerant services. </p><p>Heather is looking forward to getting to know Maxi. At Maxi's IEP meeting, she talked to Megan and Sherry. She knows the itinerant teacher Maxi had before&#x2014;the one who used to make home visits&#x2014;but she has never met Maxi. Heather knows that if she is going to help Maxi be successful in Sherry's classroom, then she first has to get to know Maxi. </p><p><b>Who Is the Child? </b></p><p>Understanding the culture, strengths, challenges, interests, and abilities of a child who is receiving itinerant services is key to planning and implementing effective interventions. IECSE teachers are different from other adults who work with the child because they have limited contact with the child. Heather only sees Maxi once a week for about an hour and a half. Because, like in this example, these professionals sometimes only have limited contact with a child, it is important that IECSE teachers gather as much information about the child from a variety of sources, including the child's family, his or her teachers, school records (including the IEP), and direct observation. Heather has read through Maxi's school file and talked to her mom&#x2014;once at the IEP meeting and once about a week ago. She has also spoken with Sherry twice&#x2014;once at the IEP meeting and once over the telephone when she called to schedule the visit. McWilliam, Casey, and Sims (2009) described the Routines-Based Interview (RBI), a process for gathering information from family members and caregivers who spend large amounts of time with the child. Interventionists, including IECSE teachers, discuss the results of the interview with the parent or caregiver, helping to identify possible outcomes that may lead to enhanced development and meaningful participation in everyday routines and activities. </p><p>The director of Maxi's preschool arranged for a substitute teacher to help out in Sherry's room for Heather's first visit, which gave Heather and Sherry some time to get to know each other. Heather used the RBI (McWilliam et al., 2009) to find out about Maxi's day. Below is part of their conversation: <i>Heather: Sherry, I'd like to talk with you about Maxi's day. Understanding what Maxi does each day will help me understand how I can best help her be successful in your classroom. Maxi is here in your classroom because her mom and everyone else on the IEP team thought it would be the best place for her to learn and prepare for kindergarten. You can do so much more for her during daily routines than I could in 90 minutes a week, and if you can share with me what her day looks like, then perhaps we can come up with a plan to best support her.<br><br> Sherry: Sure, I'd be happy to tell you about Maxi's day, but we really don't do anything Special&#x2014;just typical preschool stuff.<br><br> Heather: Well, it's that typical preschool stuff that's really going to prepare Maxi to be successful in kindergarten. Can you walk me through a typical day?<br> Sherry: Well, Maxi gets here at about 8:15 in the morning. The bus drops her off and the bus aide brings her into my classroom after she hangs up her things.<br><br> Heather: When you say, "she," do you mean Maxi hangs up her things or the bus aide hangs them up?<br><br> Sherry: The bus aide hangs them up. Maxi has enough challenges&#x2014;I didn't think she needed to worry about hanging up her things.<br><br> Heather: Okay, maybe we can talk about that later. After Maxi gets into the room, what's next? What does she like to do?</i></p><p>As the conversation above indicates, Heather asks Sherry to tell her about Maxi's day&#x2014;the kinds of activities she engages in, what Maxi likes (and does not like), and what concerns Sherry has for Maxi's success. When she asks the questions about what concerns Sherry has, Sherry admits that although she thinks that Maxi is a great little girl, she worries that maybe her classroom is not the best place for her. Sherry does not know anything about working with children who have the kind of challenges that Maxi has; and the classroom is so busy, Sherry is afraid that Maxi is going to get hurt. We'll pick up on that concern a little later. </p><p><b>Another Way of Gathering Information</b></p><p>Wolery and colleagues (2002) offered a similar approach to McWilliam and colleagues' RBI approach (2009), which was discussed previously. <i>Congruence assessment</i> offers a process that IECSE teachers can use collaboratively to identify children's strengths and challenges as they relate to participation in classroom routines and activities. In addition to observing the child in a variety of contexts (e.g., participation in classroom activities, interactions with peers, engagement in routines with parents if appropriate), reading the IEP, and engaging parents and caregivers in focused discussions, these two systematic approaches provide effective ways to gather the baseline information needed to plan meaningful interventions for the child. </p><p>Using the example above, Heather asks Sherry to describe how Maxi participates in the different routines and activities in Sherry's classroom. In addition to asking her about Maxi's likes and dislikes, Heather also asks Sherry to identify concerns she has for the way that Maxi interacts. Sherry is quick to point out that circle time is difficult because Maxi just does not want to pay attention. Instead of participating in circle time activities, she tries to interact with the children sitting next to her. Sherry finds helping Maxi use the bathroom very difficult because Maxi needs so much help. Sherry is also worried that she is going to hurt Maxi when she picks her up or helps her move from one place to the other. </p><p><b>Who Are the Adults Who Work with the Child?</b></p><p>Again, because the primary responsibility of an IECSE teacher is to help the adults who spend the majority of time with the child to deliver specialized services in the IECSE teacher's absence, it is important that the IECSE teacher know these adults. As we have discussed previously, IECSE teachers and the adults with whom they work must learn to work together effectively and productively. Buysse and Wesley (2005) emphasized the importance of building effective relationships with consultees; to do that, consultants and consultees must get to know each other. Information about the early childhood teacher's experiences with young children, including young children with disabilities, will help the IECSE teacher understand the kinds of supports and resources he or she might need. Information about the parent's education level will help the IECSE teacher understand effective ways of sharing information. Consultants should be careful to engage their consultee in conversation around these questions as opposed to using a direct interview or "interrogation" method. </p><p>After Heather and Sherry had talked about everyday classroom activities, Heather asked Sherry to tell her a little bit about herself: <i>Heather: Sherry, thanks for all of the information about your classroom. It seems like this is a great place for Maxi to learn! You must have been teaching forever! Can you tell me a little bit about your background?<br><br> Sherry: Thanks! I really don't have any special background. I've always known I wanted to be a teacher and really enjoy being around young children. In high school I used to help out in a child care center and knew that I'd found my place. After high school I enrolled in a community college and earned an associate's degree in early childhood education. I might want to go back to school one day, but for now, I'm happy doing what I'm doing.<br><br> Heather: I know what you mean about taking a break from school! I learned a lot, but all that studying and writing papers&#x2014;I don't mind not having to do that again! Is Maxi the first child that you've worked with who has an IEP?<br><br> Sherry: I had a little boy a year ago who had a speech problem and another little girl who had behavior problems&#x2014;they both had IEPs, but I never saw them. I had a class about working with kids who have special needs and sort of know what an IEP is, but I don't really know what to do with it. The other kids I worked with looked like typical kids&#x2014; Maxi's the first child I worked with who's in a wheelchair.<br><br> Heather: It sounds like you're a bit nervous about working with Maxi&#x2014;I know equipment like her wheelchair, walker, and her special chair can be a bit overwhelming at times. It seems, though, that you're really committed to doing what's best for Maxi and I hope that I can help you to feel more comfortable and confident. I know that Maxi loves coming to your classroom and between myself, the OT, and the PT, I also know that we can help you feel successful.<br><br> Sherry: You're right Heather&#x2014;working with Maxi seems overwhelming. I mean, she's a sweet little girl, but I don't want to move her the wrong way or hurt her at all. If you think I can do it, I'm up for it&#x2014;of course with your help!</i></p><p>As the conversation continues, readers can see how much Heather has learned about Sherry&#x2014;her education, experiences working with children with disabilities, and her trepidation in working with Maxi. Heather also shares some information about herself with Sherry&#x2014;disclosing relevant personal information can help build rapport and confidence in the relationship. Below are some suggestions for questions that IECSE teachers can ask their partners:</p><ul><li>What kinds of experiences has the person had with young children, including young children with disabilities? </li><li>What kinds of experience has the person had working with consultants or coaches? </li><li>What does the person know about the child's disability or associated learning difficulties? </li><li>What is the person's education level? How does she learn best? </li><li>How much time does the person have to work with a coach or a consultant? </li><li>How does the person feel about working with this child? What is he or she excited about? What is he or she concerned about? </li><li>How does the person feel about working with a coach or a consultant? What is he or she excited about? What is he or she concerned about? </li><li>What does the person expect from a coach or a consultant? </li><li>What are the person's goals for the consultative relationship?</li></ul><p><b>Understanding the Learning Environment</b></p><p>IECSE teachers such as Heather who are planning for consultation must have a solid understanding of the child's learning environment, which, in Maxi's case, is her preschool classroom. In Chapters 4 and 6, we have discussed the importance of the learning environment and its relationship to successful inclusive experiences. We have discussed using environmental rating instruments such as the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale&#x2013;Revised (ECERS-R) developed by Harms and her colleagues (Harms, Clifford, &amp; Cryer, 2005; Harms, Cryer, &amp; Clifford, 2003, 2007). Information gathered through these instruments can be very helpful in shaping the goals of the consultative relationship as well as identifying the kinds of intervention strategies needed to support children's learning.

Drawing significantly from the case of India, Prasannan Parthasarathi shows that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the advanced regions of Europe and Asia were more alike than different, both characterized by sophisticated and growing economies. Their subsequent divergence can be attributed to different competitive and ecological pressures that in turn produced varied state policies and economic outcomes. This account breaks with conventional views, which hold that divergence occurred because Europe possessed superior markets, rationality, science, or institutions. It offers instead a groundbreaking rereading of global economic development that ranges from India, Japan and China to Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire and from the textile and coal industries to the roles of science, technology, and the state.</p><p>A striking new answer to the classic question of why Europe industrialised and Asia did not. Focusing on divergence from the perspective of the Indian subcontinent, Prasannan Parthasarathi points to the plural paths of economic development which resulted from the very different pressures and needs that Europe and Asia faced.Prasannan Parthasarathi is Associate Professor in the Department of History at Boston College.

How can we strengthen them as readers and writers? How can we best prepare America's youth to succeed in the study of a foreign language? According to Classics professor David Mulroy, the most important answer is grammar! Whether championing the grammatical analysis of phrases and clauses or arguing for the vital importance of sentence diagramming, Mulroy offers a lucid, learned, passionate account of the history, importance, and value of grammar. </p> <p> Both erudite and entertaining, <i>The War Against Grammar</i> disagrees with the establishment view that the teaching of traditional grammar is a waste of classroom time. According to Mulroy, both history and commonsense make clear that students benefit from diagramming and learning their parts of speech-both during their school years and beyond. Drawing upon his classical training, Mulroy offers a close reading of the history of language study and of linguistic research to support his view that English teaching must revitalize grammar education-and that it will produce a generation better able to read and write complex texts. </p> <p> Smartly conceived and soundly executed, <i>The War Against Grammar</i> should initiate renewed debate on this critically important subject within the discipline of English Studies. </p></p><p><p>A Stanford Ph.D., Professor David Mulroy has taught Classics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee since 1973.

After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It&#39;s a &#39;culling song&#39; - an ancient African spell for euthanizing sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. Lullaby is a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk&#39;s best book yet.</p><p>The consequences of media saturation are the basis for an urban nightmare in <i>Lullaby</i>, Chuck Palahniuk's darkly comic and often dazzling thriller. Assigned to write a series of feature articles investigating SIDS, troubled newspaper reporter Carl Streator begins to notice a pattern among the cases he encounters: each child was read the same poem prior to his or her death. His research and a tip from a necrophilic paramedic lead him to Helen Hoover Boyle, a real estate agent who sells "distressed" (demonized) homes, assured of their instant turnover. Boyle and Streator have both lost children to "crib death," and she confirms Streator's suspicions: the poem is an ancient lullaby or "culling song" that is lethal if spoken--or even thought--in a victim's direction. The misanthropic Streator, now armed with a deadly and uncontrollably catchy tune, goes on a minor killing spree until he recognizes his crimes and the song's devastating potential. <i>Lullaby</i> then turns into something of a road trip narrative, with Streator, Boyle, her empty-headed Wiccan secretary Mona, and Mona's vigilante boyfriend Oyster setting out across the U.S. to track down and destroy all copies of the poem.<p> In his previous works, including the cult favorite <i>Fight Club</i>, Palahniuk has demonstrated a fondness for making statements about the condition of humanity, and he uses <i>Lullaby</i> like a blunt object to repeatedly overstate his generally dim view. Such dogmatic venom undermines the persuasiveness of his thesis about mass communication and free will, but thankfully, Palahniuk offers some respite here by allowing for sympathy and love, as well as through his razor-sharp humor, such as his mock listings for Helen's possessed properties: "six bedrooms, four baths, pine-paneled entryway, and blood running down the kitchen walls...." At such moments, <i>Lullaby</i> casts a powerful spell. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>From the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Choke</i> and the cult classic <i>Fight Club</i>, a cunningly plotted novel about the ultimate verbal weapon, one that reinvents the apocalyptic thriller for our times.<br><br>Carl Streator is a solitary widower and a fortyish newspaper reporter who is assigned to do a series of articles on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In the course of this investigation he discovers an ominous thread: the presence at the death scenes of the anthology <i>Poems and Rhymes Around the World</i>, all opened to the page where there appears an African chant, or ?culling song.? This song turns out to be lethal when spoken or even <i>thought</i> in anyone's direction?and once it lodges in Streator's brain he finds himself becoming an involuntary serial killer. So he teams up with a real estate broker, one Helen Hoover Boyle?who specializes in selling haunted (or ?distressed?) houses (wonderfully high turnover), and who lost a child to the culling song years before?for a cross-country odyssey to remove all copies of the book from libraries, lest this deadly verbal virus spread and wipe out human life. Accompanying them on this road trip are Helen's assistant, Mona Sabbat, an exquisitely earnest Wiccan, and her sardonic ecoterrorist boyfriend Oyster, who is running a scam involving fake liability claims and business blackmail. Welcome to the new nuclear family.<br><br>On one level, <i>Lullaby</i> is a chillingly pertinent parable about the dangers of psychic infection and control in an era of wildly overproliferated information: ?Imagine a plague you catch through your ears . . . imagine an idea that occupies your mind like a city.? But it is also a tightly wound thriller with an intriguing premise and a suspenseful plot full of surprising twists and turns. Finally, because it is a Chuck Palahniuk novel, it is a blackly comic tour de force that reinforces his stature as our funniest nihilist and a contemporary seer.</p><h2>Weaving Western Sakiori: A Modern Guide for Rag Weaving</h2><p>Sakiori is an approach to rag weaving used by Japanese peasants to cope with the scarcity of new cloth for clothing and household textiles. In modern times, there is instead an overabundance of cloth filling up thrift stores and being discarded. Weavers can use this source of &#x201c;rags&#x201d; to make useful and surprising new cloth. Depending on the fabric used, results can be rugged and utilitarian (like cotton rugs) or fashionable and delicate (like silk scarves). <br>The book begins with an overview of the history and context of sakiori in Japan, followed by methods and tips for successful rag weaving with a variety of materials and looms, including rigid heddle looms as well as floor looms. Charts and worksheets make it easy to find the information weavers need to get started, and 21 projects with instructions and drafts provide inspiration and ideas.</p><p>Amanda Robinette has spent the past seven years delving deeply into learning about and weaving sakiori. She has experimented with different fabrics and weave structures and focuses on making unexpected projects from rag weaving, including clothing. Her articles and projects can be found in Handwoven magazine, and she has been teaching and speaking about sakiori since 2014. She also shares her enthusiasm for sakiori and for weaving in general on her blog at westernsakiori.com. She resides in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.Weaving Western Sakiori is a comprehensive guide to the wonderful world of Japanese rag weaving. Amanda's years of researching the history of Sakiori have lead her to a clear understanding of the techniques used for weaving Sakiori and to develop her own style of weaving Sakiori, which she shares with all of us in the projects suggested in the book. &#x2013;Tom Knisely, author of Weaving Rag Rugs, Handwoven Table Linens, and Handwoven Baby Blankets (Tom Knisely)<br><br>Traditional Japanese sakiori rag weaving originated as a way to deal with a scarcity of new textiles to be made into clothing. And while many of Robinette's 21 weaving projects adhere to that tradition by repurposing old materials, a variety of the projects incorporate new textiles, tools and techniques, including rigid heddle and floor looms. There is a sett chart for rag weaving with common warp yarns, a wet-finishing chart, and instructions for preparing your chosen material. One of Robinette's inspirations offers a creative way to preserve a wedding dress as a keepsake bed runner. If only the book could supply the courage needed to make those one-of-a-kind cuts!<br><br>In today's craft scene, upcycling is a hot trend. But as Amanda Robinette points out in her new book, Weaving Western Sakiori, upcycling cloth into sakiori (traditional Japanese rag weaving) could have been a matter of survival in medieval Japan. For today's luckier weavers, Robinette's well-thought-out book is a practical and inspiring introduction to this ancient Japanese art.<br><br> Not all technical weaving books make for a good read, but Robinette inspires with her own thoughts on the artistic and environmental benefits of rag weaving., followed by a history of sakiori in Japan. I was interested to learn that the art flowered during the Edo period (1600-1868 CE) when a government-sponsored shipping fleet began to bring bales of cotton rags to northern Japan, where cotton could not be grown. Robinette's research is excellent, and she supplements in witih a number of historical and museum images, including several with jibata, the combination backstrap and treadle loom traditionally used in sakiori weaving.<br><br> True to its title, the book is an excellent "modern guide for rag weaving." Robinette has great tips on how to shop for rag-making at thrift stores and what kinds of garments and fabrics make good weaving rags. She covers rag preparation using different tools and techniques such as tearing and cutting. There are worksheets for project planning, including one for figuring how much rag weft you need, and there is a useful sett chart for weaving with different types of rags. The book includes tips on weft joins, beat, and use of temples, and a special section about rag weaving on rigid-heddle looms. The weaving instructions also include wet-finishing and drying techniques for rags of different fiber content.<br><br> If the historical perspective doesn't get you fired up for sakiori, the projects in this book certainly will. There are many sweet scarves, plus myriad household items, baby blankets, shawls, and even an elegant evening purse. Weave structures include plain weave, twills, and overshot, while materials range from cotton to silk and even include leather. As Robinette points out, her project instructions are only a starting point because your rags will be unique. And therein lies the beauty and intrigue of sakiori.

Damian Seeker, Captain of Cromwell&#39;s Guard, is all too aware of the danger facing Cromwell. Parliament resents his control of the Army while the Army resents his absolute power. In the east end of London, a group of religious fanatics plots rebellion. In the midst of all this, a stonemason uncovers a perfectly preserved body dressed in the robes of a Dominican friar, bricked up in a wall in the crumbling Black Friars. Ill-informed rumours and speculation abound, but Seeker instantly recognises the dead man. What he must discover is why he met such a hideous end, and what his connection was to the children who have started to disappear from around the city. Unravelling these mysteries is challenging enough, and made still harder by the activities of dissenters at home, Royalist plotters abroad and individuals who are not what they seem...</p><p></p><h2>Late Bloomer: How to Garden with Comfort, Ease and Simplicity in the Second Half of Life</h2><p>There are times in a gardener's life when what we <i>want </i>to do and what we <i>can </i>do are at odds.

Segismundo has been imprisoned for more than one hundred years, hidden away by his father, the king of the United States of Banana, for the crime of having been born. But when the king remarries, he frees his son, and for the sake of reconciliation, makes Puerto Rico the fifty-first state and grants American passports to all Latin American citizens. This staggering show of benevolence rocks the global community, causing an unexpected power shift with far-reaching implications.

I am redundant because I can&#x2019;t believe what I saw.

I suppose he thought his briefcase was his life&#x2014;or his wife&#x2014;or that both were one because the briefcase was as tight in hand as the wedding band.<br><br> ...<br> <br>When I came back to midtown a week after the attack&#x2014;I mourned&#x2014;but not in a personal way&#x2014;it was a cosmic mourning&#x2014;something that I could not specify because I didn&#x2019;t know any of the dead. I felt grief without knowing its origin. Maybe it was the grief of being an immigrant and of not having roots. Not being able to participate in the whole affair as a family member but as a foreigner, as a stranger&#x2014;estranged in myself and confused&#x2014;I saw the windows of Bergdorf and Saks&#x2014;what a theater of the unexpected&#x2014;my mother would have cried&#x2014;there were only black curtains, black drapes&#x2014;showing the mourning of the stores&#x2014;no mannequins, just veils&#x2014;black veils. <br><br>When the mannequins appeared again weeks later&#x2014;none of them had blond hair. I don&#x2019;t know if it was because of the mourning rituals or whether the mannequins were afraid to be blond&#x2014;targets of terrorists. Even they didn&#x2019;t want to look American. They were out of fashion after the Twin Towers fell. To the point, that even though I had just dyed my hair blond because I was writing Hamlet and Hamlet is blond, I went back to my coiffeur immediately and told him&#x2014;dye my hair black. It was a matter of life and death, why look like an American.

Inspired by his travels around the world's coastline in a camper van with his young family, William Thomson captures the cycles of the sea's movement, and intersperses his adventures surfing the waves and charting the tides. Throughout <i>Tides and the Ocean </i>are his graphic renderings of unusual tidal maps, as well as other forms of water movement, including rip, rapids, swell, stream, tide, wave, whirlpool, and tsunami.<br><i>Tides and the Ocean </i>explains how the tides surge when the moon and sun align with the earth; how ocean streams alternate direction every six hours (which is invaluable information for kayakers, paddle boarders, and fishermen); why skyscraper-sized tsunamis occur frequently in an Alaskan Bay; and the most deadly beach orientation for rip currents.

A distinguished philosopher and a practicing minister, Marilyn McCord Adams has written a highly original work on a fundamental dilemma of Christian thought&#x2015;how to reconcile faith in God with the evils that afflict human beings. </p><p>Adams argues that much of the discussion in analytic philosophy of religion over the last forty years has offered too narrow an understanding of the problem. The ground rules accepted for the discussion have usually led philosophers to avert their gaze from the worst&#x2015;horrendous&#x2015;evils and their devastating impact on human lives. They have agreed to debate the issue on the basis of religion-neutral values, and have focused on morals, an approach that&#x2015;Adams claims&#x2015;is inadequate for formulating and solving the problem of horrendous evils. She emphasizes instead the fruitfulness of other evaluative categories such as purity and defilement, honor and shame, and aesthetics. If redirected, philosophical reflection on evil can, Adams's book demonstrates, provide a valuable approach not only to theories of God and evil but also to pastoral care.</p></p><p><p>Marilyn McCord Adams is Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is the author of <i>William Ockham</i> and coeditor of<i> The Problem of Evil</i>.</p><p>"Adams argument is an important contribution to recent philosophical and theological discussions on the problem of evil.... Whether one agrees with... Adams' answer to the problem of evil, it is hard not to think that we are better off for the ways that her attempts to think about evil encourage and challenge us to take evil seriously."</p> (<i>The Hedgehog Review</i>)<br><br><p>"In this post-Holocaust world, much that passes for philosophical analysis of the problem of evil seems beside the point, if not culpably irrelevant. It is to Adams's great credit that in her often insightful discussion of the issue, she puts the emphasis where it belongs: on the victims' point of view.... A provocative book."</p> (<i>Theological Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"It would be difficult to take offense at a book which is so manifestly honest in its search for the truth, and which so clearly expresses a deep awareness of, and compassion for, the suffering and moral frailty of human beings.... Whatever their own views on the problem of evil, most readers will find insights here that they will want to hold on to."</p> (<i>Religious Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"This book is based on work on God and evil that Adams did over a period of more than a decade.... But the book is by no means a mere collection of previously published essays.... The book integrates them into a unified whole that highlights their coherence and displays connections among them. So even those who are very familiar with her earlier work on God and evil will profit from reading the book carefully.... This is a brave book. It has something fresh to say on a difficult and important philosophical topic. It deserves readers who will debate its challenging claims."</p> (<i>The Philosophical Review</i>)<br><br><p>"It is her own dissatisfaction with the usual strategies that philosophy and theology have adopted in the face of evil&#x2015;strategies that she feels underestimate either the horror of evil or the goodness of God&#x2015;that led her to mount her own philosophical alternative.... She proposes an entirely different approach. Instead of seeking reasons why a good God might permit evil, philosophy should seek an explanation of how God might 'make good' on evil."</p> (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Marilyn Adams... makes a compelling argument at several levels."</p> (<i>First Things</i>)</p><h2>Race Against Time: A Novel of Romantic Suspense</h2><p><strong>Sometimes fate brings you together...only to tear you apart</strong><br><br>Growing up in the foster system, Quinn O&#x2019;Meara made a point of never getting involved.

But while working as a nurse, one does have the opportunity to see things police can&#x2019;t see and an observant set of eyes can be quite an asset when crimes happen behind closed doors. Sometimes Detective Inspector Patton rings Miss Adams when he needs an agent on the inside. And when he does, he calls her &#x201c;Miss Pinkerton&#x201d; after the famous detective agency.<br><br> Everyone involved seems to agree that mild-mannered Herbert Wynne wasn&#x2019;t the type to commit suicide but, after he is found shot dead, with the only other possible killer being his ailing, bedridden aunt, no other explanation makes sense. Now the elderly woman is left without a caretaker and Patton sees the perfect opportunity to employ Miss Pinkerton&#x2019;s abilities. But when she arrives at the isolated country mansion to ply her trade, she soon finds more intrigue than anyone outside could have imagined and&#x2015;when she realizes a killer is on the loose&#x2015;more terror as well.<br><br> Reprinted for the first time in twenty years, Miss Pinkerton is a suspenseful tale of madness and murder.

By the end of this first volume, Kyon quickly finds out that these seemingly &#39;helpless victims&#39; of Haruhi&#39;s are actually members of secret organizations--both futuristic and alien--with the single aim of keeping watch over Haruhi Suzumiya as she is the pinnacle of some major calamity on the horizon...</p><p>Nagaru Tanigawa is a Japanese author best known for <i>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i> for which he won the grand prize at the eighth annual Sneaker Awards.

Johnston </b>is recognized as a master of the American historical novel. His grand adventures of the American West combine the grace and beauty of a natural storyteller with complete dedication to historical accuracy and authenticity. Johnston was born on the first day of 1947 on the plains of Kansas, and lived all his life in the American West. His first novel, <i>Carry the Wind,</i> won the Medicine Pipe Bearer Award from the Western Writers of America, and his subsequent books have appeared on bestseller lists throughout the country. After writing more than thirty novels, he died in March 2001 in Millings, Montana.Reining away from Troost&#x2019;s Livery, Titus Bass gave the jug-headed Indian pony urgent taps of his heels, pointing it down the muddy, rutted ruin of Second Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> Puddles of rain glittered as the sun continued its leisurely rise, the surface of each tiny pool left behind by last night&#x2019;s rain reflecting rose light like broken panes of glass scattered here and there among the heaps of wheel-cut ruts and piles of dung gone cold. Shadows still cloaked nearly all of St. Louis, save for the tallest rooftops gently steaming as they warmed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead of heading directly north, he hurried south out of town, downriver some four miles until he reached the shady glen far from the clutter of settlement and folk. Far from the clatter of man&#x2019;s comings and goings. Someplace far from being underfoot. After all this time Titus was again gratified at the utter peace he sensed there as he halted, dismounted, and tied the two animals off to one of the trees ringing the glade. Plodding quietly in his thick-soled boots across the grassy carpet grown lush already this early spring, he had no trouble locating the mound. Stopping a few feet away, he took it in, finding many of the wildflowers he had transplanted nearly a year before budding once again with renewed life here above the old trapper&#x2019;s resting place.<br> &nbsp;<br> Down in this grove the shadows lingered long of a morning. And the damp mist clung in among the trees, wispy among the climbing ivy and grape. Eventually, Titus inched forward, stopping at the foot of the grave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Isaac. It&#x2019;s me: Titus,&#x201d; he said barely above a whisper, the way a man might first address someone he found sleeping. &#x201c;I come ... come here to tell you my fare-thees, Isaac. I&#x2019;m bound away&#x2014;for where the two of us was counting on going together. Out yondering to them prerras and far mountains you told me of again and again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he realized and suddenly snatched the floppy felt hat from his head, dropping his eyes as if in apology for his discourteous oversight.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wish you was going along,&#x201d; Bass continued. &#x201c;Probably asking yourself why I ain&#x2019;t gone already, ain&#x2019;cha? So let me tell you that you being here&#x2014;dead and buried&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the onliest reason I ain&#x2019;t gone afore now. There I was, planning all the time on tagging &#x2019;long with you ... then you go and get yourself kill&#x2019;t. That was&#x2014;hell, it felt just like one of them old brood mares I was shoeing for Troost gone and kicked me right in the gut.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He dropped the hat onto the foot of the grave there among the profusion of newly emerging wildflowers and slowly went to his knees. Placing one palm flat on the grave, Titus continued.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Took me some time to get over your dying, Isaac Washburn. Pained me like few other things ever pained me afore in my life. I was counting on something so hard&#x2014;then you go and act the idjit and you&#x2019;re gone ... gone along with my dreams of ever getting to them Shining Mountains you seen with your own eyes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt that first sting of tears burn, and swiped at his eyes with a single cold finger as a ray of sun burst through the canopy overhead, the first to streak into the glade.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Took me a long time to get over the loss of you and my dreams both, Isaac. Didn&#x2019;t get over it till I up and figgered out I could damn well go on my own. I didn&#x2019;t need you like I figured I did. Got me a fine gun of my own now. The rest of our plunder and truck tied up in them bundles over yonder on them horses. And I&#x2019;m riding your pony my own self. Taking it back to the prerra where I figure it belongs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Slowly he dragged a sleeve of his blanket coat beneath his dribbling nose and sighed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At first I hated what you done to both of us, Isaac. For killing yourself and killing my dream of going to them far mountains by way of the Platte with you. Nursed on that hate for too damn long&#x2014;so long that I didn&#x2019;t ever come back here to speak at you ... not since I buried you in this pretty place. I&#x2019;m glad to see you ain&#x2019;t kill&#x2019;t the flowers I planted over you, you sour-assed son of a bitch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he gradually rose to his feet, sweeping up his hat and snugging it down upon his thick; curly brown hair, glancing at the single shaft of sunlight streaming into the glade, slowly marching across the nodding grass toward the grave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Best be going now, Gut. Wanted to come to tell you I was on my way out yonder. Don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;d ever get back this way. And ... and I come to tell you I owe you more&#x2019;n I&#x2019;d ever be able to pay you. So&#x201d;&#x2014;and he swallowed hard, tasting the ball of sentiment at the back of his throat&#x2014;&#x201c;so I figure the only way I&#x2019;ll ever come close to repaying you for what good you done me ... is to go on out yonder and live the way your kind was meant to live. The way I callate I was meant to live out my days too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Swiping the palm of his hand across his whole face, smearing tears and his blubbering nose, Titus bent quickly and patted the top of the grave mound with a hand, then straightened.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fare well, Isaac Washburn,&#x201d; he whispered, barely above a harsh croak. &#x201c;Thanks to you, I&#x2019;ll fare well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hurrying back to the horses, he untied them quickly and vaulted onto the pony&#x2019;s back, glanced once at the shaft of sunlight just then touching the old trapper&#x2019;s resting place, the wildflowers grown luminescent with that first blush of dawn&#x2019;s light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tapping the pony&#x2019;s ribs, he moved out once more. North this time. Back four miles to St. Louis. By the time he reached town and Second Street once more, the day was birthing to the east across the mighty river.<br> &nbsp;<br> Titus Bass hadn&#x2019;t felt this new in more years than he cared to remember.<br> &nbsp;<br> While he owned far less than his pap had owned at thirty-one, far less than his grandpap before him, at this moment Titus now possessed more than he had ever claimed before in his life. Not much in the way of prize stock: not this hand-me-down Indian pony he was riding, nor Hysham Troost&#x2019;s gift of an old dun mare to use as a packhorse. And there sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t all that much strapped in two modest blanket-wrapped bundles lashed on the back of the mare as he was taking his leave of this place. Yet in that moment as the sun rose at his shoulder, Titus Bass realized he was a wealthy man nonetheless.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most men would simply never be this free.<br> &nbsp;<br> Second Street ended at the far edge of town where the muddy, rutted road northwest to St. Charles began. The sun had climbed above the tops of the leafing trees by the time he left the last huts and shanties behind. No more did the air reek of offal and refuse pitched carelessly into the streets. No more did his nose discern the tang of woodsmoke on the damp dew of the morning. It lay behind him now. So much lay behind him now.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the rest of his ever-living life was spreading itself before him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Turning in the saddle to watch the last of the hovels disappear behind him, Titus gazed at the smoke columns rising from hundreds of chimneys and stacks above the thick green canopy. Then he took a deep breath. And a second, his eyes half closing as it sank into his lungs. No morning had ever tasted sweeter.<br> &nbsp;<br> That early spring morn, in the year of 1825, Titus Bass was barely thirty-one. Not a youngster by any means. He&#x2019;d been broke to harness more than once. Time and again in his life he had come to know the value of hard work. And, too, Titus realized he was near twice the age of a few of those fellows who had been hiring out to the fur companies pushing their keels up the muddy Missouri River lo these past four-odd years. While he might be green at what he&#x2019;d set his course to do, he sure as the devil wasn&#x2019;t wet behind the ears.<br> &nbsp;<br> By damn, those years under his belt ought to count for something besides mere seasoning. Why, a hiring man would be hard-pressed to find any new hand more eager to pit himself against those prairies and plains, those high and terrible places that now lay before Titus Bass.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where the well-traveled road twisted itself up the long, gradual slope and emerged from the oak and elm, Bass reined up and turned about to gaze back at the riverside town. Stone estates hid behind high walls where the French protected themselves from the lower classes. Those long rows of warehouses along Wharf Street, tiny shops of all descriptions pressed elbow to elbow along Main. And on the outskirts lay the smoke-blackened shanties where the whiskey and rum was poured, where the women of all hue and size plied their ancient trade.<br> &nbsp;<br> Excerpt From: Terry C.

She thought she heard a voice calling her from outside, but she&#x2019;d been wrong before. It was probably the rushing of the rain, or the lash of the wind through the trees. Still, she listened, hoping.<br>&#x201c;Babe?&#x201d; Sam paused on the stair, resting his hand on the banister. He looked back at her, his eyes a puzzled blue behind his glasses. &#x201c;Did you forget your phone?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, I thought I heard something.&#x201d; Jill didn&#x2019;t elaborate. She was in her forties, old enough to have a past and wise enough to keep her thoughts about it to herself.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Sam asked, patiently. It was almost midnight, and they&#x2019;d been on their way to bed. The house was dark except for the glass fixture above the stairwell, and the silvery strands in Sam&#x2019;s thick, dark hair glinted in the low light. Their chubby golden retriever, Beef, was already upstairs, looking down at them from the landing, his buttery ears falling forward.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing, I guess.&#x201d; Jill started back up the stairs, but Beef swung his head toward the front of the house and gave an excited bark. His tail started to wag, and Jill turned, too, listening again.<br><i>Jill! Jill!</i><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Abby!&#x201d; Jill heard it for sure, this time. The cry resonated in her chest, speaking directly to her heart. She turned around and hurried for the entrance hall, and Beef scampered downstairs after her, his heavy butt getting ahead of him, like a runaway tractor-trailer.<br>&#x201c;Abby who?&#x201d; Sam called after her. &#x201c;Your ex&#x2019;s kid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Jill reached the front door, twisted the deadbolt, flicked on the porch light, and threw open the door. Abby wasn&#x2019;t there, and Jill didn&#x2019;t see her because it was so dark. There were no streetlights at this end of the block, and the rain obliterated the outlines of the houses and cars, graying out the suburban scene. Suddenly, a black SUV with only one headlight drove past, spotlighting a silhouette that Jill would know anywhere. It was Abby, but she was staggering down the sidewalk as if she&#x2019;d been injured.<br>&#x201c;Sam, call 911!&#x201d; Jill bolted out of the house and into the storm, diagnosing Abby on the fly. It could have been a hit-and-run, or an aneurysm. Not a stroke, Abby was too young. Not a gunshot or stab wound, in this neighborhood.<br>Jill tore through the rain. Beef bounded ahead, barking in alarm. The neighbor&#x2019;s motion-detector went on, casting a halo of light on their front lawn. Abby stumbled off the sidewalk. Her purse slipped from her shoulder and dropped to the ground. Abby took a few more faltering steps, then collapsed, crumpling to the grass.<br>&#x201c;Abby!&#x201d; Jill screamed, sprinting to Abby&#x2019;s side, kneeling down. Abby was conscious, but crying. Jill reached for her pulse and scanned her head and body for signs of injury, and there were none. Rainwater covered Abby&#x2019;s face, streaking her mascara and blackening her tears. Her hair stuck to her neck, and rain plastered her thin sundress to her body. Her pulse felt strong and steady, bewildering Jill. &#x201c;Abby, Abby, what is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have to&nbsp;... hold me.&#x201d; Abby raised her arms. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br>Jill gathered Abby close, shielding her from the rain. She&#x2019;d held Abby so many times before, and all the times rushed back at her, as if her very body had stored the memories, until that very moment. Jill flashed on the time Abby had fallen off her Rollerblades, breaking an ankle. Then the time Abby had gotten a C on her trig final. The time she didn&#x2019;t get picked for the travel soccer team. Abby had always been a sensitive little girl, but she wasn&#x2019;t a little girl anymore, and Jill had never seen her cry so hard.<br>&#x201c;Abby, honey, please, tell me, and I can help.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say it&nbsp;... it&#x2019;s so awful.&#x201d; Abby sobbed, and Jill caught a distinct whiff of alcohol on her breath and came up to speed. Abby wasn&#x2019;t injured, she&#x2019;d been drinking. Jill hadn&#x2019;t seen her in three years, and Abby had grown up; she&#x2019;d be nineteen now. Abby sobbed harder. &#x201c;Jill, Dad&#x2019;s dead&nbsp;... he&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>What?</i>&#x201d; Jill gasped, shocked. Her ex-husband was in excellent health, still in his forties. &#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Somebody&nbsp;... killed him.&#x201d; Abby dissolved into tears, her body going limp, clinging to Jill. &#x201c;Please, you have to&nbsp;... help me. I have to find out&nbsp;... who did it.&#x201d;<br>Jill hugged her closer, feeling her grief and struggling to process what had happened. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine William as a murder victim, or a victim of any kind, for that matter, but her first thought was of his daughters, Abby and Victoria, and her own daughter, Megan. The news would devastate all of them, Megan included. William was her stepfather, but the only father she&#x2019;d ever known. Her real father had died before she was born.<br>&#x201c;Babe, what are you doing? Let&#x2019;s get her into the house!&#x201d; Sam shouted, to be heard over the rain. He was kneeling on Abby&#x2019;s other side, though Jill didn&#x2019;t know when he&#x2019;d gotten there.<br>&#x201c;William&#x2019;s been murdered,&#x201d; Jill told him, sounding numb, even to herself.<br>&#x201c;I heard. We&#x2019;re not calling 911, she&#x2019;s just drunk.&#x201d; Sam squinted against the brightness of the motion-detector light. Raindrops soaked his hair and dappled his polo shirt. &#x201c;Let me take her arm. Lift her on one, two, three,&#x201d; he counted off, tugging Abby&#x2019;s arm.<br>&#x201c;Okay, go.&#x201d; Jill took Abby&#x2019;s other arm, and together they hoisted her, sobbing, to her feet, gathered her purse, and half walked and half carried her toward the house, sloshing through the grass, with Beef at their heels.<br>Jill tried to collect her thoughts, which were in turmoil. She&#x2019;d always dreamed of seeing Abby again, but not in these circumstances, and she dreaded telling Megan about William. But as agonized as she felt for the girls, Jill wouldn&#x2019;t shed a tear for her ex-husband. There was a reason she had divorced the man, and it was a whopper.<br>And evidently, not only the good died young.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Lisa Scottoline<br></p><h2>A Primer of Jungian Psychology</h2><p>The contributions of Carl Jung to understanding of the human psyche are immense. Starting as Freud's most famous disciple, Jung soon broke away from his mentor to follow his own lines of investigation and discovery. Many of Jung's ideas are now considered fundamentals in the study of the mind, but other, more controversial theories dealing with the psychological relevance of alchemy, ESP, astrology, and occultism are only now being seriously examined. This condensation and summary of Jung's life and work by two eminent psychology professors is written with deep understanding and extraordinary clarity and, along with its companion volume, <b>A Primer Of Jungian Psychology</b> is essential reading for anyone interested in the hidden depths of the mind.</p><p><b>Calvin S.

Peter discovered the Grateful Dead in 1985, at the age of 15, through friends who exchanged bootleg tapes of live Grateful Dead concerts. A teenager living in the suburbs of Rochester, New York, he became exposed to an entirely new way of life, and friends who were enjoying more freedom and less parental guidance. At the age of 16, he attended his first Grateful Dead concert on June 30, 1987 - he was hooked. Between 1987 and 1995, Conners would attend Dead 'shows' all over the United States. He traveled with a makeshift 'family' of other Deadheads in a Volkswagen camper, selling drugs and whatever else would provide gas money to the next concert. His hair was a wild, unkempt bush and baths were infrequent. In short, he had progressed from suburban kid, to Grateful Dead fan, to full-blown Deadhead. Chronicling this progression, which culminates with the 1995 death of Jerry Garcia, Conners reveals the truth behind Deadhead culture and history. The result is a riveting insight into the obsessive fandom that made The Grateful Dead the most successful touring band of all time, as well as a cultural phenomenon.</p><p><b>Peter Conners</b> has written extensively about music and counterculture, including his books <i>Growing Up Dead: The Hallucinated Confessions of a Teenage Deadhead, <em>JAMerica: The History of the Jam Band and Festival Scene</em>, and <em>White Hand Society: The Psychedelic Partnership of Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg</em></i><em>. He lives in Rochester, New York, where he is Publisher of BOA Editions, Ltd.</em><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i>, 1/26/09</b><br> &#x201c;Offers a perspective often missing from other Dead chronicles: that of one of the suburban teens who dropped out of high school and/or college to follow a band...Earnest and often hilarious...What really went on at a typical Dead show in the 1980s.&#x201d;<br><p><b><i>Kirkus</i>, 2/1/09</b><br> &#x201c;Insightful and entertaining.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Dennis McNally, author of <i>A Long Strange Trip</i></b><br> &#x201c;The hardest part of being the Grateful Dead&#x2019;s publicist was convincing the media that Deadheads were diverse, thoughtful, and not infrequently accomplished. If I&#x2019;d just had a copy of <i>Growing Up Dead</i>, I could have simply handed it out. The Deadhead subculture was rich and fascinating, and this book is a terrific documentation of it.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Nissan Altima 1993 thru 2006 (Haynes Repair Manual)</h2><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Whether you work for a storefront social action agency or a leading university, the authors' knowledgeable, practical advice will help you:<br> <br> Write the perfect proposal&#x2014;from the initial research and interviews to the final product<br> <br> Draft, revise, and polish a "beguiling, exciting, can't-put-it-down and surely can't-turn-it-down" request for funds<br> <br> Create case statements and other big money materials&#x2014;also write, design, and print newsletters, and use the World Wide Web effectively<br> <br> Survive last-minute proposals and other crises&#x2014;with the Down-and-Dirty Proposal Kit!<br> <br> <i>Writing for a Good Cause</i> provides everything fund raisers, volunteers, staff writers, freelancers, and program directors need to know to win funds from individual, foundation, and corporate donors.</p><p>Writing for nonprofits is a juggling act. One's job might entail writing grant proposals, newsletters, thank-you notes, case statements, and Web-site material--each for a different boss. The most successful development writers take the time to both experience their causes firsthand (sleep in the shelter, go to rehearsals, visit the wilderness) and cultivate personal relationships with their donors ("people give to people"). You'll give yourself an amazing head start when applying for a grant, say Joseph Barbato and Danielle Furlich, just by following an organization's guidelines and getting your math right--it's surprising how many fundraisers do neither. Make your point once, clearly, and don't forget the human element. "You aren't just asking for money," say the authors of <i>Writing for a Good Cause</i>, "you are asking to help people." Barbato and Furlich, both veteran fundraisers, interviewed both grants administrators and development writers for this guide. The result is an inside view of the arcane workings of the world of fundraising that would make any novice feel more proficient immediately. Their "gotta-get-it-out-right-now, how-late-is-FedEx-open? Down-and-dirty proposal kit" is a terrific tool when there isn't time to write the "knockout, beguiling, exciting, can't-put-it-down, and surely can't-turn-it-down fundraising proposal." And keep in mind: when a donor gives your proposal the nod, say thank you. Twice. In fact, say Barbato and Furlich, "It is almost impossible to thank a donor too much." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>Joseph Barbato&nbsp;is president of Barbato Associates, which provides writing and design services to the fund-raising programs of nonprofits.

She has supported the development and growth of permaculture nationally through her input as trustee of the Permaculture Association (Britain) for 5 years (2001-2006) and was the Chairperson for two of these. Looby lives in Herefordshire with her partner Chris Evans and two daughters. She enjoys singing, yoga, gardening and making all sorts of things from cakes to wine and clothes to blankets. She is the author of <em>People &amp; Permaculture: Caring &amp; Designing for Ourselves, Each Other &amp; the Planet</em>.</p><p>"This book is cause for celebration! Many of us have long hankered for the insights and principles of permaculture to be translated to serve all aspects of our lives. Looby Macnamara has been worth waiting for: she fills the bill with luminous clarity, lean eloquence and an exquisite knowledge of systems. Her opening chapters on 'Thinking Like an Ecosystem' should be required reading in every classroom from third grade through graduate school. Equally rewarding are her applications of permaculture to health, communication and the life of the mind. It's part of the genius of the book that all this, once you see it, can seem as natural as breathing."<strong>--Joanna Macy, Author of <em>Coming Back to Life, World as Lover, World as Self</em> and co-author of <em>Active Hope: How to Face the Mess We're in without Going Crazy</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"This is indeed a timely and very important book. Now, more than ever, we need to find ways of working together if we are to create a world in which our grandchildren can and want to live in. I am confident that we already have the tools to practically build a future in harmony with the Earth, but our greatest challenge is how to live in harmony with each other to enable us to do so. Looby's book provides the very tools we need to undertake this vital work."<strong>--Tim Harland, Founder of <em>Permaculture</em> magazine</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"The application of permaculture principles and thinking to peoplecare has long been a vexed issue for permaculture activists, designers and teachers. In this book Looby Macnamara uses her solid grounding in permaculture to show that its principles and thinking can help us all be effective and hopeful in an age of change and challenge. In the process she draws in kindred ideas and influences from the field of peoplecare, making a significant contribution in the ongoing evolution of permaculture as a concept and a movement creating a better world."<strong>--David Holmgren, Co-originator of the Permaculture concept, author of <em>Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"Peoplecare is as important to permaculture as earthcare - unless we learn to live in harmony with each other, we'll never get anything done. Looby's book fills a gap that has long been there in permaculture literature. I heartily congratulate her."<strong>--Patrick Whitefield, Author, <em>The Earth Care Manual</em> and <em>How to Make a Forest Garden</em></strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p><br> We all have our dark moments of the soul, when we go deep into our individual beings and ask hard questions and sometimes get unwelcome answers. Are humans a plague on the planet? Can one person, when that one person is me, really make a difference? Can the juggernaut of consumer society be turned? Why should we single out our fellow humans for a special degree of care over, say, salmon, or whales? The answer is in this book. We take care of people because people matter, and because that is our nature as creatures who care. What we care about matters to the fate of the world, now as never before. If permaculture as a design tool is about making connections, this book is about how we reconnect ourselves - to each other, to our inner selves, to our highest aspirations and, finally, to the cycles of life, of which we are just a small, but incredibly important, part."<strong>--Albert Bates,Author and educator, The Farm Ecovillage Training Center</strong><br> <br> </p><br><br><p>"The future of culture and agriculture is in permaculture. This book is perhaps the first to give readers the big picture and a comprehensive understanding of permaculture and how it can underpin our ecological, social and spiritual paradigm. The book is an outstanding contribution to an ever evolving vision which is creative, imaginative, sustainable and joyful."<strong>--Satish Kumar, Editor, <em>Resurgence</em> magazine and author of <em>No Destination</em></strong></p></p><h2>Nasty Galaxy</h2><p><b>From Sophia Amoruso, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>#GIRLBOSS</i>, a lushly illustrated embodiment of the collective spirit of the Nasty Gal brand, Sophia&#x2019;s own personal brand, and girlbosses everywhere, with a foreword by Courtney Love.

Then history repeats itself when, in the confusion, Garrett is shot dead.<br><br>Father John O&#x2019;Malley knows in his heart the Arapaho are not guilty.

Originally a historian by trade, she is considered an expert on the Arapaho Indians. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.Recalling age-old atrocities, Native Americans find their emotions inflamed by the appearance of George Armstrong Custer reenactor Edward Garrett, who leads the general&#x2019;s 7th Cavalry Regiment in a parade to launch the rodeo season. As Arapaho men perform an intricate and confusing &#x201c;dare ride&#x201d; around the cavalry, Garrett is shot and killed, with Indians widely considered at blame. But, as Father John O&#x2019;Malley learns, it isn&#x2019;t just Indians who hated Custer. Then glad-handing attorney Skip Burrow disappears, leaving his office ransacked with traces of blood and his secretary and lover, Angela Running Bear, distraught. When Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden learns that Garrett and Burrow had recently met, she&#x2019;s certain the cases are connected; with O&#x2019;Malley, she starts following the money. This seventeenth Wind River mystery, particularly rich in historical detail, dramatizes various tensions in the community, including that between Native Americans who stay on the rez and those who leave it. And despite the fact that Adam Lone Eagle is Vicky&#x2019;s live-in boyfriend, something more than friendship between her and Father John continues to simmer.

Part I examines the science and magic of the Otherworld that guides you on this journey. Part II expands on the interpretations of the 78 cards. In addition to Toney's insightful descriptions, Holly shares the inspirations for her Chrysalis artwork and presents her original black and white sketches for each card. Foreword by Tali Goodwin.</p><p>Many tarotists read the cards as if they're decoding a message. Accordingly, they depend a great deal upon precise, univalent meanings that they can memorize. That's fine, but the understanding of how tarot works is evolving. Chrysalis should never be read simply by rote. It's multivalent, dynamic, and should be read through the perceptive lens of one's Third Eye using the innate faculties of intuition, instinct and active imagination. <br><br>This companion book will teach you how to sharpen these faculties and introduce you to the exciting new worldview of a living, connected universe. We regard tarot spreads as jumping off points for meaningful, dynamic dialogue with divine realms, the definition of <i>divination</i>. Readers who depend upon precise card interpretations and rigid consistency will likely be dissatisfied with this book and should save their money.

Twelve years later, Ruzo&#x2014;now a geoscientist&#x2014;hears his aunt mention that she herself had visited this strange river.<br> <br>Determined to discover if the boiling river is real, Ruzo sets out on a journey deep into the Amazon. What he finds astounds him: In this long, wide, and winding river, the waters run so hot that locals brew tea in them; small animals that fall in are instantly cooked. As he studies the river, Ruzo faces challenges more complex than he had ever imaged.<br> <br><i>The Boiling River</i> follows this young explorer as he navigates a tangle of competing interests&#x2014;local shamans, illegal cattle farmers and loggers, and oil companies. This true account reads like a modern-day adventure, complete with extraordinary characters, captivating plot twists, and jaw-dropping details&#x2014;including stunning photographs and a never-before-published account about this incredible natural wonder. Ultimately, though, <i>The Boiling River</i> is about a man trying to understand the moral obligation that comes with scientific discovery &#x2014;to protect a sacred site from misuse, neglect, and even from his own discovery.</p><p>Andr�s Ruzo is a geoscientist and a National Geographic Young Explorer. <i>The Boiling River</i> is his first book.Boiling River 1<p></p> Revelations in the Dark<p></p> <br>I am standing on a rock in the middle of a river. Nighttime in the jungle pours around me. Instinctively, I reach up and turn off my headlamp. The blackness is complete now and I pause, waiting. I had missed the darkness. I breathe in. The air is thick and abnormally hot, even for the Amazon. As my eyes adjust to the dark, the outline of the jungle slowly distinguishes itself from the night: blacks, grays, dark blues, even silvery whites. It&#x2019;s amazing what we miss when the lights are on. The moon is hardly a sliver, and innumerable stars dominate the sky above, illuminating the vast jungle and bathing each leaf and rock with their soft light. All around me, vapors rise like ghosts in the starlight. Some are thin streams of mist; others are clouds so large that their billowing appears to be in slow motion.<br> <br>I lie down on the rock and am still, watching the steam rise into the night. When a cool breeze blows, the mists thicken and roll, forming pale gray-blue eddies against the sky. The rock beneath my body glows dimly white in the faint light. Where my back and legs touch the rock&#x2019;s surface, I&#x2019;m sweating lightly. A torrent of water, hot enough to kill me, wider than a two-lane road, surges past my rock, emitting a roar that drowns out the jungle&#x2019;s nighttime chorus. My senses are sharp and every movement is keenly deliberate.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon. The other members of my team are in bed in the tiny community nearby, but there is no way I can sleep&#x2014;not with what is before me here. My heart is beating hard, but I feel a complete calm. My eyes follow the river&#x2019;s vapors as they rise and melt into the firmament. The Milky Way flows across the sky like a reflection of the river below. The Inca referred to the Milky Way as the Celestial River, a path to another world, a place inhabited by spirits. So the vapors join two great rivers here. It&#x2019;s clear why the people who live here regard this jungle as a place of such spiritual power. The shaman&#x2019;s words echo in my head: &#x201c;The river shows us what we need to see.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is becoming one of the greatest adventures of my life. This will be the story I tell my children and grandchildren&#x2014;and every action I make in this moment adds a new piece of the story. Every passing second now seems to hold a greater significance. Burning-hot water splashes on my right arm. I sit up, pulling my arm to my chest, no longer lost in thought. I recall my professor&#x2019;s words from volcanology field school: &#x201c;The people who die on volcanoes are the inexperienced who are ignorant of the dangers and the experts who have forgotten they are dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stand, make sure I have a firm footing, and jump back onto the nearest shore. As I look back at the Boiling River I can&#x2019;t suppress an excited whisper: &#x201c;This place exists. This place actually exists.&#x201d; I remember the shaman saying the river has called me here for a purpose, and I can feel a greater mission about to take place. I won&#x2019;t get much sleep tonight.<br> <br>The vapors dance in the starlight as I make my way back to my hut, my mind filled with thoughts of the river, the dark jungle surrounding it, and the story that remains to be written. It&#x2019;s a story that began with a legend heard in childhood&#x2014;a story of exploration and discovery, driven by a need to understand what initially appeared unbelievable. It&#x2019;s a story where modern science and traditional worldviews collide&#x2014;not violently but respectfully&#x2014;united in their sense of awe for the natural world.<br> <br>At a time when everything seems mapped, measured, and understood, this river challenges what we think we know. It has forced me to question the line between known and unknown, ancient and modern, scientific and spiritual. It is a reminder that there are still great wonders to be discovered. We find them not just in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of everyday life&#x2014;in the things we barely notice, the things we almost forget, even in a detail of a story.</p><h2>26 Italian Songs and Arias: Medium Low Voice, Book &amp; CD</h2><p>This authoritative edition of the world&#39;s most loved songs and arias draws on original manuscripts, historical first editions, and recent research by prominent musicologists to meet a high standard of accuracy and authenticity.

On the one hand it alludes to the departure from the Church of Scotland of about forty ministers and many members. On the other hand it refers to the catalyst of these actions the departure of the Kirk from its moorings in the authority of Scripture by its decisions on 'the gay question'. <br><br><i>A Sad Departure</i> tells a dark story, almost novelesque in character. A church's Theological Commission reaches a unanimous conclusion on the teaching on marriage given in its ultimate authority, the Bible. But then its General Assembly acts in a way that ignores, demeans, and rejects that teaching. Thus behind these sad departures lies the prior and much sadder departure of the Kirk from its sacred constitution.<br><br>This is a thoughtful, honest and solemnising book written out of a deep personal and pastoral concern for the cause of the gospel.</p><p>David J. Randall was born in Edinburgh in 1945 and attended Leith Academy Primary School and George Heriot's Secondary. He graduated in arts and divinity at Edinburgh University and then studied for a Th.M. at Princeton Theological Seminary. After assistantships in Broomhouse and Carrick Knowe, he served as minister of Macduff Parish Church in Aberdeenshire from 1971 to 2010, where he preached through the whole Bible. He has served the wider church in various capacities, including a term as convener of the Church of Scotland's Apologetics Committee (now 'Why Believe?'). He is now retired from full-time pastoral ministry, and serves as chairman of the Solas Centre for Public Christianity based in Dundee. <br><br>David's publications include 'Believe It or Not!' answering objections to the Christian faith, and 'Grace Sufficient' (a biography of missionary Elizabeth Mantell of Malawi). He contributed a regular newspaper column, 'It Makes You Think' for the Banffshire Journal for 26 years, and more recently has edited 'Why I Am not an Atheist: Facing the Inadequacies of Unbelief', published in 2013.'David Randall has written a lucid manifesto explaining why he and others are leaving the Church of Scotland now. While that may seem a narrow issue of no concern to believers in the rest of the world, it is certainly not. The arguments he proffers for departure from the historic church stand equally true and compelling for any believer or pastor in any denomination or association whose official doctrine declares a departure from the word of God, written and incarnate.' --<i>John MacArthur</i></p><h2>A Bluestocking Guide: Building a Personal Model for Success</h2><p>"A Bluestocking Guide: Building a Personal Model for Success" is designed to reinforce and enhance a student's understanding of the subject matter presented in the primer "Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career, and Financial Security" an Uncle Eric book by Richard J. Maybury. Comprehension Questions are given for each chapter and may include Definition, True/False, and/or Short Answer/Fill-in questions. Answers are located in the back of the study guide. &nbsp;(Note: student answers to some questions/exercises do not always have definitive answers, in which case the notation "answers will vary" will appear.) Application Exercises are also given. Generally, these ask the student to apply the knowledge he/she learned from a given chapter to "real world" situations so that the student may personalize the information and better retain and apply the knowledge gained from the primer. &nbsp;Application Exercises typically include Discussion, Essay, and Research assignments. A comprehensive final exam is also included. In addition to assisting the student in the retention of the subject matter, the study guide will serve as documentation of course completion. Timeframe for Study: Bluestocking Guides are organized to allow the instructor flexibility in designing the ideal course of study for the student. Therefore, there is no "right" or "wrong" timeframe for covering the material; the instructor should tailor the study of the primer and study guide to the student's unique school schedule, learning style and age. For example, younger students might only complete comprehension exercises in the study guide, whereas older students may complete additional application exercises and suggestions for further reading/study. Ideally, the student should read the chapter from the primer and then immediately answer the corresponding questions in the study guide. For Essay and Research assignments, a project may require several days or weeks to complete. It is best that the instructor preview these assignments to select those most appropriate for the student and the timeframe available. An easy-to-apply rule of thumb for determining length of study is to divide the number of chapters in a primer by the number of weeks the instructor plans to study the subject/book. &nbsp;Some instructors may choose to complete the primer in a few short weeks, in which case multiple chapters may need to be covered for each lesson period. &nbsp;Others may cover the primer over the course of a semester, in which case only one or two chapters per week will need to be assigned. (Note: &nbsp;Chapter lengths vary, so sometimes a student may easily be able to read more than one chapter per lesson.) &nbsp;The key is to move quickly enough so that the student is engaged with learning and also able to absorb all concepts fully. The student's performance on end-of-chapter Questions and Assignments from the study guide should be a good indication of this. This guide is 8-1/2" x 11" in size.<br><br>Description of the primer, "Uncle Eric Talks About Personal, Career, and Financial Security": In this extensively revised and expanded second edition, Uncle Eric introduces the concept of model. Models (or paradigms) are how people think; they are how we understand our world. Models help us recognize and use the information that is important and bypass that which is not. To achieve success in our careers, investments, and every other part of our lives, we need sound models. In this book, Mr. Maybury introduces the models he has found most useful (Economics and Higher Law). This is the first book in the Uncle Eric series and, while designed to stand alone, provides an excellent foundation for Maybury's other books.

A huge entwined business, farming and ranching are the state's dominant land use. Yet few Californians understand what animals and crops are raised or how agriculture reflects our relationship with nature. This fascinating and gorgeously illustrated field guide gathers essential information about agriculture and its environmental context, and answers the perennial question posed by California travelers: &#x201c;What is that, and why is it growing here?&#x201d; Paul F. Starrs's lively text explores the full range of the state's agriculture, deftly balancing agribusiness triumphalism with the pride of boutique producers, sketching meanwhile the darker shadows that can envelop California farming. Documented with diverse maps and Peter Goin's insightful photographs, <i>A Field Guide to California Agriculture</i> captures the industry's energy and ingenuity and its wildly diverse iconography, from the mysteries of forbidden crops (like marijuana) to the majesties of scale in food production.</p><p>"This book brings to life one of the most creative (and necessary) human endeavors and makes understandable the incredible complexity of California agriculture, one of the world's most daring experiments in feeding itself. A valuable resource that should be read by everyone&#x2015;not just those of us who farm, but all of us who depend on farms."&#x2015;Michael Ableman, farmer, photographer, and author of <i>From the Good Earth, On Good Land,</i> and <i>Fields of Plenty.</i> <br><br>"No understanding of this state is possible without an understanding of its agriculture; that's how important this subject is."&#x2015;Gerald Haslam, author of <i>Workin' Man Blues: Country Music in California</i><br><br>"A fascinating, intriguing, and sometimes even humorous exploration of California's agriculture, from broccoli to marijuana and beyond.

The themes that run through Florine's 101 ascents of Yosemite's most iconic route can benefit people who will never climb a rock, indeed anyone inspired by the idea of a passionate, lifelong quest of any type. &#x2014;Jim Collins, author of Good to Great<br><br>Hans Florine is a big-wall climbing legend in his own time. He holds the speed record on the Nose route of El Capitan, a 3,000-foot granite cliff in Yosemite Valley that&#x2019;s considered the Everest of the rock-climbing world. Ascending the Nose takes most climbers anywhere from 12 to 96 hours. Florine, along with climbing partner Alex Honnold, does it in an astounding 2.5 hours.<br><br>But Florine&#x2019;s story is not one of super-human athletic prowess; it&#x2019;s one of persistence and dogged determination. In 30 years of climbing, he's ascended the Nose a mind-blowing, death-defying 100 times, more than anyone else ever has, and most likely ever will. In On the Nose, Florine describes the most dangerous, pivotal, and inspirational of those climbs, providing a rare look inside the adrenaline-charged world of competitive climbing in Yosemite Valley. He tells of his very first attempt on the Nose, which ended in failure after 14 hours, his friendships (and rivalries) with climbing&#x2019;s most colorful personalities, and his battle with Dean Potter to secure the definitive speed record on the Nose&#x2014;an endeavor that&#x2019;s been called the wildest competition known to man.<br><br>Perhaps most interestingly, Florine attempts to answer the question why. Why would anyone undertake one of the greatest adventure epics on earth 100 times? His answers provide unique insights on how to live a satisfying life, how to achieve big goals, and how an otherwise ordinary guy can become a rock star.</p><p>In addition to his climbing accolades, Hans Florine is the coauthor of Speed Climbing, and has contributed to three other books, as well as written articles for Rock and Ice and Climbing. Hans served as executive director of the American Sport Climbers Federation from 1992 to 1996, and is currently an Ambassador for The Access Fund, as well as manager and shareholder at Touchstone Climbing &amp; Fitness, the largest climbing gym chain in the country. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, and maintains strong relationships, fundraising and otherwise, with Yosemite Conservancy, Outward Bound, The Access Fund, American Safe Climbing Association, American Alpine Club, Sierra Club, and Nature Bridge.

He was suffering from shock, internal injuries and a compound fracture of the right fibula. Yet he was probably the luckiest man she'd ever known. He'd survived.<br><br>The team of doctors worked vigorously over him, doing everything possible to keep him alive. Although she was busy performing her own role in this drama, Norah was curious. It wasn't every day a man literally fell out of the sky into their backyard. Whoever he was, he'd been involved in a plane accident. From what she heard when they'd rushed him in, he'd made a gallant effort to land the single-engine Cessna in a wheatfield, but the plane's wingtip had caught the ground, catapulting it into a series of cartwheels. That he'd managed to crawl out of the wreckage was a miracle all its own.<br><br>She tightened the blood-pressure cuff around his arm and called out the latest reading. Dr. Adamson, the surgeon in attendance, briskly instructed her to administer a shot.<br><br>Their patient was young, in his early thirties. And handsome in a rugged sort of way. Dark hair, chiseled jaw, stubborn as a mule from the looks of him. His clothes, at least what was left of them, told her he was probably a cowboy. She suspected he rode in the rodeo circuit&#x2014;successfully, too, if he was flying his own plane.<br><br>She glanced down at his left hand. He wasn't wearing a wedding ring and that eased her mind somewhat. Norah hated the thought of a young wife pacing the floor, anxiously waiting his arrival home. Of course, that didn't mean he wasn't married. A lot of men didn't wear wedding rings, particularly if they worked with their hands. Too dangerous.<br><br>His leg was badly broken, and once he was stabilized, he'd be sent into surgery. She didn't have a lot of experience with compound fractures, but her guess was that he'd need to be in traction for the next few weeks. A break as complex as this would take months, possibly years, to heal properly.<br><br>Norah wasn't scheduled to work tonight, but had been called in unexpectedly. She should've been home, had <em>planned </em>to be home, preparing for her oldest sister Valerie's wedding. Half of Orchard Valley would be in attendance&#x2014;it was widely considered the event of the year. And five weeks after that, her second sister, Steffie, would be marrying Charles Tomaselli, in a much less formal ceremony.<br><br>There was definitely something in the air this summer, Norah mused, with both her sisters planning to get married.<br><br><em>Love </em>was what floated in the air, but it had apparently evaded Norah. There wasn't a single man in Orchard Valley who stirred her heart. Not one.<br><br>She was thrilled for her sisters, but at the same time she couldn't help feeling a bit envious. If any of the three could be described as "the marrying type," it was Norah. She was by far the most domestic and traditional. Ever since she was a teenager, Norah had assumed she'd be the first of the three sisters to marry, although she was the youngest. Valerie had hardly dated even in college, and Steffie was so impulsive and unpredictable that she'd never stood still long enough to get serious about anyone. Or so it had seemed....<br><br>Now both her sisters were marrying. And this had all happened within two short months. Only weeks ago Norah would have been shocked had anyone told her Valerie would become a wife. Her oldest sister was the dedicated career woman, working her way up the corporate ladder with CHIPS, a Texas-based computer software corporation. At any rate, that was what Valerie <em>had </em>been doing&#x2014;until she flew home when their father suffered a heart attack. Before Norah was aware of it, Valerie had fallen head over heels in love with Dr. Colby Winston.<br><br>Try as she might, she couldn't picture her sister as a wife. Valerie, who was so much like their father, was a dynamic businesswoman. She'd accepted the sales job with CHIPS and in less than four years had moved into upper management. She was energetic, spirited and strong-willed. If her sister was going to fall in love, Norah didn't understand how it could be with Dr. Winston. He was just as dedicated to his work, just as headstrong. To Norah's way of thinking, they had little in common&#x2014;except their love for each other. In fact, watching them together had taught Norah a few things about love and commitment. They were both determined to make their marriage work, both willing to make compromises, to change and to mediate their differences.<br><br>If Valerie was going to get married at all, Norah had always assumed she'd choose someone like Rowdy Cassidy, the owner of CHIPS. For months, Valerie's phone calls and e-mails had been full of details about the maverick software developer. He'd taken Wall Street by storm with his innovative ideas, and his company had very soon become one of a very few to dominate the field. Valerie greatly admired him. But she'd given up her position with CHIPS without so much as a second's regret. There were other jobs, she'd said, but only one Colby Winston. And if she had to choose, as Cassidy had forced her to do, then that choice was clear. But then Norah had never seen anyone more in love&#x2014;unless it was Steffie.<br><br>Her second sister had arrived after a long, difficult trip, to be with their father and almost the same thing had happened. Suddenly, she and Charles Tomaselli, the <em>Orchard Valley Clarion's </em>editor and now its publisher, had clashed. They'd been constantly at odds, but gradually that had changed. Not until much later did Norah learn that Charles was the reason Steffie had decided to study in Italy&#x2014;both to escape him and because, thanks to him, she'd become fascinated with Italian art and culture. Steffie had been wildly in love with Charles, and Norah wasn't sure what had gone wrong, but whatever it was had sent Steffie fleeing. She guessed there'd been some sort of disagreement between them&#x2014;not that it mattered. What <em>was </em>important was that Steffie and Charles had patched things up and admitted their true feelings for each other.<br><br>In typical Steffie fashion, her sister was planning a thoroughly untraditional wedding. The exchange of vows was to take place in the apple orchard, between the rows of trees with their weight of reddening apples. The reception would be held on the groomed front lawn; there would be musicians playing chamber music in the background. The wedding cake was to be a huge chocolate concoction.<br><br>So, within a few weeks of each other, her two sisters would be married. Unlike Valerie, Norah hadn't recently met a new and wonderful man. And unlike Steffie, she didn't have a secret love, someone she'd felt passionate about for years. Unless she counted Clive Owen. Norah figured she'd seen every movie he starred in ten times over. But it wasn't likely that a dashing actor was going to show up in Orchard Valley and fall passionately in love with her. A pity, really.<br><br>An hour later, Norah was washing up, preparing to head home. The cowboy, although listed in critical condition, had stabilized. He might not feel like it now, but he was lucky to be alive. The surgery on the right fibula would follow, but she wasn't sure exactly when.<br><br>Eager to leave the hospital, Norah was on her way out the door when she heard someone mention the cowboy's name.<br><br>She stopped abruptly, nearly tripping in her astonishment. <em>"Who </em>did you say he is?" she demanded, turning back to her friends.<br><br>"According to the identification he carried, his name is Rowdy Cassidy."<br><br>"Rowdy!" Susan Parsons, another nurse, laughed. "It's a perfect name for him, isn't it? He looks rowdy. Personally, I don't want to be around when he wakes up. I'm betting he's going to have all the charm of an angry hornet."<br><br>Rowdy Cassidy. Norah took a deep breath. The man was Valerie's employer. Former employer, she amended. He must've been flying in for the wedding when the accident occurred.<br><br>Norah wasn't sure what she could do with the information. Valerie, who was cool as a watermelon on ice when it came to business dealings, was a nervous wreck over this wedding.<br><br>Love had taken Valerie Bloomfield by surprise and she hadn't recovered yet. Mentioning Rowdy's accident to her sister now didn't seem right; Valerie had enough on her mind without the additional worry. Yet it didn't seem fair to keep the truth from her, either.<br><br>Who should she tell, then, Norah wondered as she walked to the staff parking lot. Surely someone should know....<br><br>It was late, past midnight, when she entered the house. Although there were several lights on, she didn't see anyone around. The wedding was at noon, less than twelve hours away.<br><br>Secretly Norah had hoped her father might still be up, but she didn't really expect it. He went to bed early these days and slept late, his body regaining its strength after the physical ordeal of a heart attack and the subsequent life-saving surgery.<br><br>"Hi," Steffie said cheerfully. She hurried downstairs, cinching her robe at the waist as she walked. Her long dark hair was damp and fell arrow-straight to the middle of her back. "I wondered what time you'd be home."<br><br>Norah stared up at her, frowning in concentration. She'd discuss this with Steffie, she decided, see what her sister had to say.<br><br>"What happened?" Steffie asked, her voice urgent.<br><br>"There was a single-engine-plane crash." Norah hesitated. "Fortunately only one man was aboard."<br><br>"Did he survive?"<br><br>Norah nodded and worried her lower lip. "Is Valerie asleep?"<br><br>Steffie sighed. "Who knows? I'd never have believed Valerie would be this nervous before her wedding. Good grief, she's arranged multimillion-dollar business deals."<br><br>"Come in the kitchen with me," Norah said, looking quickly up the staircase. She didn't want Valerie hearing this.<br><br>"What is it?" Steffie asked as she followed her into the other room. Valerie's room was directly above, but there was little chance she'd overhear the conversation.<br><br>"The man who was involved in the plane accident..."<br><br>"Yes?" Steffie prodded in a whisper.<br><br>"Is Rowdy Cassidy."<br><br>"What?" Steffie pulled out a stool at the counter and sank down on it. "You're sure?"<br><br>"Positive. Apparently he was flying in for the wedding."<br><br>"More likely he intended to stop it," Steffie said sharply.<br><br>"Stop it? What do you mean?"<br><br>Steffie's expression was intense. "Well, you know that when Valerie talked to him about opening a branch on the West Coast, he was in favor of the idea, but he wanted someone else to head it up. He refused to give her the job and said she'd have to stay in Texas if she wanted to stay with CHIPS. In other words, unless she chooses Rowdy Cassidy and her career over Colby and marriage. In fact, he seems to think he can persuade her to do just that."<br><br>"What a rotten way to act!"<br><br>Steffie agreed. "Valerie was furious. She'd hoped to continue working for CHIPS after she's married. But Rowdy was so unreasonable, she didn't have any alternative except to resign. When she announced she was marrying Colby, Rowdy didn't seem to believe her&#x2014;still doesn't. Apparently he thinks it was some ploy to get him to declare his love."<br><br>"I take it Mr. Cassidy doesn't know Valerie very well." Her sister was nothing if not direct, Norah mused with a small smile. Valerie would never stoop to orchestrating such a scene, or exploiting a man's feelings for her.<br><br>When Valerie first flew home after their father's heart attack, Norah had suspected her sister might've been attracted to her employer. In retrospect, she realized Valerie greatly admired and liked Rowdy, but wasn't in love with him. Her reactions to Colby made that abundantly clear.<br><br>"But why do you think he wanted to stop the wedding?" Norah asked. If Rowdy did love her sister, he'd certainly waited until the last minute to do something about it.<br><br>"He phoned two days ago.... I took the call," Steffie said, a guilty expression crossing her face. "I didn't tell Valerie, but then&#x2014;how could I?"<br><br>"Tell her what exactly?"<br><br>"That Rowdy asked her not to do anything...hasty until he'd had a chance to talk to her."<br><br>"Hasty?" Norah repeated. "Like what?"<br><br>"Like go through with the wedding."<br><br>"He had to be joking."<br><br>"I don't think so," Steffie said grimly. "He was dead serious. He claimed he had something important to say to her and that she should put everything on hold until he got here."<br><br>"And you didn't tell Valerie?"<br><br>"No," Steffie returned, her gaze avoiding Norah's. "I guess I should have, but when I told Dad&#x2014;"<br><br>"Dad knows?"<br><br>"He didn't seem the least bit surprised, either." Steffie folded her arms around her middle and slowly shook her head. "He just smiled and then he said the oddest thing."<br><br>"When hasn't he?" Norah muttered.<br><br>Steffie agreed with a smile.<br><br>"What was it this time?"<br><br>Steffie didn't answer right away. She stared down at the counter for a moment. Finally she glanced up, giving a baffled shrug. "That Rowdy was arriving right on schedule."<br><br>Norah found the statement equally puzzling. "Do you think Rowdy might have called earlier and spoken to Dad?"<br><br>Once again Steffie shrugged. "Who knows?"<br><br>"But Dad seemed to feel you shouldn't say anything to Valerie about Rowdy's call?" Norah pressed.<br><br>Steffie nodded. "Yeah. He says she's got enough to worry about. I couldn't agree more. As far as I'm concerned, Cassidy had his chance. He accepted her resignation, which worked out fine since it gave Valerie more time to get everything organized for the wedding. From what she said recently, I think she might start doing some consulting. You know, help companies upgrade their computer systems."<br><br>"That's a great idea," Norah murmured.<br><br>"It isn't the wedding arrangements that have unsettled Val." Steffie spoke with the authority of one who knew. "It's being in love."<br><br>"Love," Norah repeated wistfully.<br><br>"Valerie's never been in love before, that's what threw her. Not the wedding plans or all the organizing or even the job situation."<br><br>"What surprises me the most," Norah said, recalling the past few weeks, "is how she immediately becomes composed whenever Colby's around."<br><br>"He's her emotional anchor," Steffie said knowingly. "Like Charles is mine. And&#x2014;"<br><br>"Should I say anything to Val about Rowdy Cassidy?" Norah broke in.<br><br>"Sure," Steffie told her, "but my advice is to wait until after the ceremony."<br><br>Norah concurred, frowning a little.<br><br>"How badly was he injured?" Steffie asked.<br><br>"He's in critical condition and is scheduled for surgery on his leg. I think he'll be in traction for some time. He suffered some internal injuries, too, but they don't appear to be as serious as we first assumed."<br><br>"So he'll be pretty well out of it until after the wedding, anyway?"<br><br>"Oh, yes. He's not expected to fully regain consciousness until sometime tomorrow afternoon&#x2014;if then."<br><br>"Then I suggest we let sleeping dogs lie," Steffie said. "It's not like a visit from Valerie would do him any good&#x2014;at least, not now."<br><br></p><h2>Permaculture for the Rest of Us: Abundant Living on Less than an Acre</h2><p><p><strong> Adventures on the road to real-world self-sufficiency </strong></p><p> Many of us want to increase our self-sufficiency, but few have access to the ideal 5 sunny, gently-sloping acres of rich, loamy, well-drained soil.

Hodding Carter</b> <br><br> When we consider the amenities that really make a difference in our well-being, surely good plumbing must rank near the top. But rarely have we taken the time to appreciate the engineering marvels that bring clean water into our homes with the turn of a tap and the flip of a lever. Until now. <br> <br> Witty, anecdotal, and thoroughly entertaining, <i>Flushed</i> chronicles the long and notable history of plumbing, while following Hodding Carter's travels and travails around the most underappreciated pillar of civilization. It's a winning combination of history, science, and firsthand experience -- a book that will both entertain and educate those who have never contemplated the hidden intricacies of this miracle of everyday technology.</p><p><b>W. Hodding Carter</b> has written for several national magazines, including <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Smithsonian</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, and <i>Outside</i>. The author of <i>Westward Whoa, A Viking Voyage</i>, and <i>An Illustrated Viking Voyage</i>, he lives with his family in Rockport, Maine.Though it's a pretty safe bet that the only people who pick up this book will be those who interested in sewage, the author's easy humor, average homeowner's point-of-view, and excitement for his subject should ensnare the casual browser. The book's also extensive: Carter, a history and nature author, discusses water-delivery and sewage systems from the height of Rome to the sewers of London to present-day Boston. Anecdotes and interviews pair well with thorough history and technical explanation, and Carter reserves a chapter to discuss the plumber himself: his profession, his training, and why, in the case of a nuclear holocaust, plumbers "will be our knights in droopy jeans." Though he can be a little too loose with the toilet-humor (chapter 12 is called "The Power of Poop"), his populist, live-and-in-color approach could make this a crossover hit.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But hardly anyone knows anything about him. About the only two things that more people 'know' about Patrick is that he was Irish and Roman Catholic. In truth, he was neither. He was British, and he belonged to the autonomous Celtic church. Although Patrick is the most famous person of his age, the real man has been buried in a cloud of myths. Myths such as: <br><br> He used the shamrock to explain the Trinity. <br><br> He was sent to Ireland by the Pope. <br><br> He was a wonder-worker who staged miraculous duels with the Druids. <br><br> <i>Let Me Die In Ireland </i> cuts through all of the myths about Patrick and presents the authentic, stirring account of one of the greatest missionaries who ever lived. His life is a compelling testimony to the incredible power of the gospel when preached and lived by a man of integrity. He gave up a comfortable life as an upper-class citizen of Roman Britain to live in poverty, suffering, and constant danger in Ireland. Forsaking all, he brought Christ's love to the hated enemies of his own people to the very nation who had once kidnapped and enslaved him. Although ridiculed and rejected by his own people in Britain, Patrick changed the course of an entire nation.</p><p>A former attorney and Anglican priest, David Bercot has made early Christianity his special field of study for the past fifteen years. His primary mission is to make the average layperson aware of the early Christians what they believed and how they lived. A member of the North American Patristics Society, Bercot is also the editor of <i>A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs</i>.Sixteen year old Patrick felt the cool tingle of the wet grass on his feet as he strolled through his father's farm on this late spring morning. As was typical for the west coast of Britain, dense fog enveloped all of the hills and farm buildings. Patrick was excited that his parents had let him stay at their country villa while his father took care of business in London. He had assured them that he was old enough to take care of himself and would be just fine. Besides, he would be in the company of their many servants. <p>As his sandal-covered feet sloshed through the moist green grass, Patrick's thoughts were on horses and his formal education that would begin in a few weeks. Patrick wasn't looking forward to his schooling at all. Nothing but endless drills, memorization, and study. Those things were okay for the bookish boys. But Patrick was a man of action not books. </p><p>"People say I'm an empty-headed dreamer, but they'll see. Someday, I'll be governor of Britain," Patrick said to himself, as he tossed his blond head with an air of importance. He stopped on a grassy knoll and drank in the sweet fragrance of spring. The aroma of the damp, rich earth, laced with the perfumed scent of lilacs, tantalized his nostrils. To the east, he could barely make out the outline of his father's barn. He imagined it to be the governor's palace, where he would live someday. To the north, he could faintly see the outlines of the grazing cows. He pretended they were prize stallions from Arabia. </p><p>Turning to the west, Patrick visualized that he was addressing an adoring crowd of his fellow Britons. In the gray fog, he imagined he could see the throng in front of him. He could faintly make out their bodies and faces. They seemed so real. But, of course, he was just imagining things. Or was he? He rubbed his eyes for a few seconds and scrutinized the fog again, hoping it was simply a mirage. However, the ghostly figures were still there, and they seemed to be approaching him. </p><p>Suddenly, several blood-curdling shrieks emerged from the fog, followed by the terrifying blast of discordant battle horns. Patrick stood frozen with fear as the phantom figures suddenly materialized from the fog, brandishing swords and spears, heading straight for him. Recovering from his initial shock, Patrick turned and ran as fast as he could towards his parents' villa. </p><p>Everywhere pandemonium reigned. Women screamed. Dogs barked. Sheep bleated and ran in terror. Servants blindly raced about in the fog like a flock of chickens scattered by a pack of dogs. Those who tried to resist the armed warriors were mercilessly hacked to death or impaled with spears. Patrick darted nimbly toward the outer courtyard of the villa, his heart beating wildly. He dared not look back. I've got to make it through the gates before they catch me. Once I barricade the gates, I'll be safe. However, as Patrick approached the heavy oak gates, he suddenly stopped in alarm. Another band of warriors was already waiting there. </p><p>Patrick whirled around to run to the hills, but instead he ran pell mell into a pursuing raider. Although he was an athletic youth, he was no match for the tall, muscular warrior. The man grabbed him by his shoulders and threw him roughly to the ground. Patrick landed hard on his back, and his head fell against a large stone. Everything went black.</p></p><h2>Playing for Keeps: A Heartbreaker Bay Novel (Heartbreaker Bay, 7)</h2><p><p><strong><em>If you&#x2019;re planning on falling in love...<br></em></strong>When it comes to the confident, charismatic Caleb Parker, Sadie Lane feels the spark&#x2014;the kind that comes from rubbing each other the wrong way.

But as Slavenka Drakulic observes, "in everyday life, the revolution consists much more of the small things&#x2014;of sounds, looks and images." In this brilliant work of political reportage, filtered through her own experience, we see that Europe remains a divided continent. In the place of the fallen Berlin Wall there is a chasm between East and West, consisting of the different way people continue to live and understand the world. Little bits&#x2014;or intimations&#x2014;of the West are gradually making their way east: boutiques carrying Levis and tiny food shops called "Supermarket" are multiplying on main boulevards. Despite the fact that Drakulic can find a Cafe Europa, complete with Viennese-style coffee and Western decor, in just about every Eastern European city, the acceptance of the East by the rest of Europe continues to prove much more elusive.</p><p>Slavenka Drakulic was born in Croatia in 1949. The author of several works of nonfiction and novels, she has written for <b>The New York Times</b>, <b>The Nation</b>, <b>The New Republic</b>, and numerous publications around the world.Drakuli's eloquent and brave essays demand that the citizens of post-Communist Eastern Europe take personal responsibility for their roles in the new civil society. Over the past five years, Croatian journalist and novelist Drakuli (The Balkan Express, 1993; Holograms of Fear, 1992) has emerged in the English-speaking world as a consistent, honest, stylish, and canny interpreter of Eastern Europe and ex-Yugoslavia. Her latest contribution continues that tradition (some may argue to the point of repetition), offering Drakuli's trademark essays that reach for the pulse of a country or an era by homing in on everyday events and encounters. Like her previous work, Cafe Europa serves as a protest against an East European tendency, based on decades- long experience under paternalist dictators, to shirk civic responsibility. ``How does a person who is a product of a totalitarian society,'' she asks, ``learn responsibility, individuality, initiative? By saying `no.' '' Although her canvas encompasses all of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, her own Croatia bears the brunt of Drakuli's penetrating criticism. One unforgettable essay depicts Croatian president Franjo Tudjman as an object of vitriolic contempt. Both the everyday and the political milieu of post-Communist Croatia are ready subjects for Drakuli's combination of wit, scorn, and introspection. From the renaming of the streets and cutting down of trees in Zagreb, to a colleague's uncritical interview with an unrepentant Croatian Fascist, to the author's own experiences as a consumer in America and as a Croat in Israel, the Croatian essays form the backbone of this collection. Nevertheless, these 24 essays, written between 1992 and 1996, are informed by the author's image of the lands of Eastern Europe as the ``infantile nations of our continent,'' sharing a common desire--``our longing for Europe and all that it stands for.'' General readers interested in understanding the gritty realities of post-Communist Eastern Europe should grab a coffee and sit down with Cafe Europa.

All hands to the roof of Shark House!&#x201d; Marc Lee&#x2019;s breathless bark snapped me out of sleep.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t think as I jolted off my cot, stuck my bare feet in my Oakley boots, and grabbed my web gear, machine gun, helmet, and night-vision goggles (NVGs). I ran hot on Marc&#x2019;s heels, in nothing but a pair of PT shorts and some assault gear, as we raced the hundred yards to the roof like sharks toward blood in the water.<br><br> Impending violence permeated the Euphrates&#x2019;s musty breeze.<br><br> &#x201c;Muj swimmers trying to attack Blue Diamond,&#x201d; Marc called over his shoulder as we hit the ground-floor entrance to the house. Camp Blue Diamond was the Marine base across the river to our east. We bounded up the stairs, untied boot laces whipping our bare shins. On the roof, we joined about twenty other Teamguys, most of us in PT shorts and bare chested, the unofficial uniform for middle-of-the-night, just-out-of-your-rack muj hunting. I saw an occasional T-shirt and had to stifle a chuckle when I noticed Guy, one of our officers, and his perfect uniform. A hodgepodge of support guys intermixed among us. When Marc said all hands, he had meant all hands. Everybody wanted to get his war on.<br><br> The muj had sent a sorry contingent of maritime fighters to attack the Marine base. Blue Diamond had alerted our tactical operations center (TOC), who in turn had coordinated the perfect L-shaped ambush. We stood poised, waiting for the green light from our base defense operations center on Camp Ramadi. Our mismatched uniforms and patchwork appearance belied our deadly potential. We stood, silently, vipers waiting to strike.<br><br> Somebody was going to have a bad night.<br><br> Guy was on my left. Marc Lee and Ryan Job fell in alongside him. JP was to my right. We were new to war, but our brotherhood spanned many generations and was forged by a proud warrior tradition. We were ready.<br><br> A few spots to my right, a support guy named Neal was armed to the teeth. I stifled another chuckle. His gear was an arsenal of grenades, M4 mags, and trinkets. He had no NVGs. I turned my attention back across the quiet river. My night vision infiltrated the darkness, and I could see movement. I pushed the safety off on my gun and turned on my infrared laser.<br><br> Then the command came.<br><br> Three, two, one. Execute.<br><br> Together, we unleashed hell on the river below and the unsuspecting muj lurking in its waters. It was euphoric. I methodically delivered 150 rounds in precise eight-to-ten-round bursts. The tracers screamed across the water. Some hit and stuck; others deflected and fizzled into the night. The intense energy of American ordnance and thunder of machine guns singing all around left no doubt in my mind: I was born for this.<br><br> I looked around me at every other man doing exactly the same thing and realized that this is how it had always been. Since the first man threw a rock, to when a man chucked a spear, to when another man aimed his rifle, it has come down to a man, his weapon, and the brothers who will fight with him. At that moment, everyone who mattered to me was on that rooftop. Nothing existed beyond Ramadi. These were the men who would bring me out alive, as I would them. I had literally nothing but my gun and my brothers. I hope it will always be like this.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t notice my scalding-hot shell casing ejecting toward JP&#x2019;s exposed leg to my right. I didn&#x2019;t care. When the abrupt call to cease fire finally came, my ears rang, my hands tingled, and the enemy was dead or dying. I felt alive.<br><br> Someone was yelling at Neal for firing six mags at the enemy with no night vision on. We called him Shadow Stalker for the rest of the deployment. A gunner&#x2019;s mate tech asked sheepishly, &#x201c;Hey, man, am I going to get my Combat Action Ribbon for this?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, man,&#x201d; I said, deciding to let him revel in his glory for a little while.<br><br> I checked my left flank. Guy, Marc, and Ryan had the familiar look of satisfaction that operating a powerful weapon delivers. JP cussed the burns on his left calf from my brass. I shrugged and took a deep breath. The smell of cordite from hundreds of spent rounds mixed with a breeze from the Euphrates&#x2019;s ancient waters. I put my gun on safe and hit the pressure pad for the laser. I grabbed my gear and began the walk back to my tent, wondering how many similar opportunities I&#x2019;d have like this over the next seven months. I didn&#x2019;t want it to change me, or us&#x2014;any of us. I didn&#x2019;t think ahead to the future&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d be as a man or a husband or father a decade later. It didn&#x2019;t matter at the time. I just needed to clean my gun. I was in Ramadi, and I&#x2019;d be back in my rack before the flies found the meat we&#x2019;d left for them in the reeds.<br><br> Later, I lay awake for only a moment before falling into a satisfied sleep, confident in the work I&#x2019;d done with the others.<br><br><i>I hope it will always be like this.</i></p><h2>Platero and I</h2><p>: One of the great classics of modern Spanish literature. Sheer descriptive magic. Time An exquisite bookrich, shimmering, truly incomparable. The New Yorker This enchanting dialogue, or is it a monologue, between a man and his burro has been translated with great skill and sympathy. Winthrop Sargeant In this translated Spanish classic, Juan Ram�n Jim�nez tells his burro Platero about their native Andalusian village of Moguer. Their dialogue creates an evanescent portrait of provincial Spainits streets, homes, animals, children, and eccentrics. With the pure-hearted, silent burro sometimes a witness, sometimes a participant, the routines of daily life take on a certain poignancy. Jim�nez anxiously searches for and removes the long green thorn from Plateros hoof, and the donkey tenderly nuzzles him. On their way home one evening, Platero brays to his girlfriend burro in a field and trots hesitatingly, unwillingly past. Together Platero and his master make friends with the parrot, belonging to a local French doctor, whose sole and frequent pronouncement is Ce nest rien. Both prolific and profound, Juan Ram�n Jim�nez (1881-1958) wrote over seventy books, winning the 1956 Nobel Prize in literature. He has been hailed by The New Republic as not only the dean of Hispanic poets, but a pioneer and the source of all those who wrote in the Spanish tongue after him. The translator, poet and scholar, Antonio de Nicol�s, received his education in Spain, India and the United States. A prolific writer, he has contributed to learned journals, magazines and book reviews and has published a number of books.</p><p>"One of the great classics of modern Spanish literature.

"Curry," she informs us, correctly refers to a range of dishes calling for differing blends of spices known as "masalas." Coconut, curry leaves, and mustard seeds are particularly key in the wet masalas often used by her aunt and others in Southern India. MacMillan offers intelligent substitutions, where necessary. <i>Curried Favors</i> provides detailed directions so you can comfortably try dishes such as Idli, Yogurt, Aviyals, Kichadis, and Pachadis as well as more familiar northern favorites such as Khormas and Biriyanis.

Referring to St. Peter, who holds the keys to Heaven, its name is suggestive of the plant&#x2019;s visionary power to open the gates between the visible and invisible worlds, allowing passage to an ecstatic realm where miraculous physical and spiritual healings occur, love and enthusiasm for life are rekindled, the future divined, and the soul&#x2019;s purpose revealed. <br> <br>Exploring the history and shamanic uses of the San Pedro cactus, Ross Heaven interviews practicing San Pedro shamans about ancient and modern rituals, preparation of the visionary brew, experiences with the healing spirit of San Pedro, and their teachings on how the cactus works on the mind, body, and illness.

Nelson, who, prior to his call into the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was a pioneering cardiac surgeon. Today, as an Apostle, he understands our hearts in a new way most particularly, he understands our need for hope in our hearts. As a special witness of Jesus Christ, he testifies powerfully of where that hope can be found. In Hope in Our Hearts, Elder Nelson brings his remarkable grasp of the gospel and his unique medical training to bear in eighteen outstanding messages that focus on family and relationships, Church doctrine, and personal growth. The book includes such classic addresses as: Nurturing Marriage, Jesus Christ The Master Healer, and The Magnificence of Man, as well as some talks that aren t widely available, such as The Family: The Hope for the Future of Nations, a landmark message given at the World Congress on Families V. An introduction written especially for this book includes important experiences, lessons, and photographs from his life. All of God s children encounter challenges and frustrations in life, writes Elder Nelson. That is part of our mortal experience. We also know that truly faithful people are produced not by fleeting flashes of exuberant effort but by continuous consistency in keeping the commandments of God. As we follow Jesus Christ, pressing forward one step at a time, we can do all that the Lord would have us do.</p><p>Elder Russell M. Nelson was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in April 1984. Prior to his call, he was a world- renowned cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, medical researcher, and educator. He received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah and a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, and has served as president of the Society for Vascular Surgery and chairman of the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery for the American Heart Association. He and his wife, the late Dantzel Nelson, are the parents of ten children. Dantzel Nelson passed away in February 2005. Elder Nelson married Wendy L. Watson, a professor of marriage and family therapy in BYU s School of Family Life, in 2006.</p><h2>Twisted (Pretty Little Liars, Book 9)</h2><p><p><strong>#1</strong> <em><strong>New York Times </strong></em><strong>bestselling series</strong></p><p>The ninth book in the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling series that inspired the hit ABC Family TV show <em>Pretty Little Liars.</em></p><p>It's been a year since the mystery of their former friend's disappearance was finally laid to rest, and Aria, Spencer, Hanna, and Emily have worked hard to put their lives back together.

Prisons, Brett Story shows, are more than just buildings of incarceration bound to cycles of crime and punishment. Instead, she investigates the production of carceral power at a range of sites, from buses to coalfields and from blighted cities to urban financial hubs, to demonstrate how the organization of carceral space is ideologically and materially grounded in racial capitalism.</p><p>Story&#x2019;s critically acclaimed film <i>The Prison in Twelve Landscapes</i> is based on the same research that informs this book. In both, Story takes an expansive view of what constitutes contemporary carceral space, interrogating the ways in which racial capitalism is reproduced and for which police technologies of containment and control are employed. By framing the prison as a set of social relations, <i>Prison Land</i> forces us to confront the production of new carceral forms that go well beyond the prison system. In doing so, it profoundly undermines both conventional ideas of prisons as logical responses to the problem of crime and attachment to punishment as the relevant measure of a transformed criminal justice system.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Brett Story is a documentary filmmaker, geographer, and assistant professor in the School of Image Arts at Ryerson University.

This testimony is so frequently repeated that only a fool dare challenge it. The contrary view found in Vital Vintage Church, however, comes from someone who actually attends church every Sunday, someone who currently teaches in two mainline denominational seminaries, consults with dozens of mainline churches, and stands in the pulpit almost every Sunday of a mainline church where he is the senior pastor.From that vantage point, Rev. Michael Piazza has seen enough signs of hope to convince him that, if we can change the narrative of doom and gloom, many of our Vintage Churches are poised to experience a time of great renewal. It won&#x2019;t happen if we continue to do business as usual, but it also won&#x2019;t require us to abandon the church we love. Taking out the pews and the stained glass isn&#x2019;t the answer, but changes will be required. So, take a breath, take the plunge, and take it from one whose daily ministry is proving THERE IS HOPE FOR THE MAINLINE CHURCH!</p><p>Rev. Michael Piazza is a spiritual visionary, author, consultant, and civil rights activist who currently serves as senior pastor of Virginia-Highland Church in Atlanta, Georgia.

Yet through the centuries it has been probed and dissected, weighed and examined, its text peeled back for its underlying history, its discourse analyzed and its words weighed. Could there be any stone in Sinai yet unturned? Surprisingly, there is. From a career of study, John Sailhamer sums up his perspective on the Pentateuch by first settling the hermeneutical question of where we should set our attention. Rather than focus on the history behind the text, Sailhamer is convinced that it is the text itself that should be our primary focus. Along the way he demonstrates that this was in fact the focus of many interpreters in the precritical era. Persuaded of the singular vision of the Pentateuch, Sailhamer searches out clues left by the author and the later editor of the Pentateuch that will disclose the meaning of this great work. By paying particular attention to the poetic seams in the text, he rediscovers a message that surprisingly brings us to the threshold of the New Testament gospel.</p><p><strong>John H. Sailhamer</strong> is professor of Old Testament at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Brea, California. He is the author of several books, including <em>Introduction to Old Testament Theology</em> and <em>The Pentateuch as Narrative.</em>"Sailhamer illustrates the kind of fresh and creative thinking on the OT that is possible for an evangelical scholar." (Joe M. Sprinkle, Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, December 2010)<br><br>"Sailhamer has made a valuable contribution to both Pentateuchal studies and the larger field of biblical theological studies." (Roger D. Cotton, Enrichment, Winter 2011)<br><br>"An interesting evangelical position in language accessible to all." (James Chukwuma Okoye, The Bible in Review)<br><br>"For years John Sailhamer has been pressing toward a comprehensive work on the Pentateuch, preparing the way with such works as his <em>The Pentateuch as Narrative</em> and a host of periodical publications on the subject. At last the magnum opus has appeared under the title <em>The Meaning of the Pentateuch: Revelation, Composition and Interpretation.</em> In typical Sailhamer fashion, he has left no stones unturned in any language necessary to get to primary and secondary sources, while at the same time offering fresh insights into the biblical texts and compelling invitations to the reader to view them in more holistic and integrative ways. Careful reading of the book will inevitably call for a reexamination of the issue of the Pentateuch's antiquity and its deliberate compositional strategy, a reassessment that will help to rehabilitate Torah as not the end product of Judaism but as the foundation of Israelite faith and practice."

Merrill, Distinguished Professor of Old Testament Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary, and Distinguished Professor of Old Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)</p><h2>Red Corner: The Rise and Fall of Communism in Northeastern Montana</h2><p><i>The Red Corner</i> chronicles the events of the teens and 1920s that left a permanent mark on the region. Sheridan County was the site of an armed robbery of $100,000 from the county treasury, a Young Communist camp, an adolescent's "Bolshevik funeral," and surveillance by FBI agents who pursued some radical leaders even into the 1960s. The book profiles several influential Communists including a colorful newspaper editor who was elected state senator and later national chairman of the Farmer Labor Party, as well as his comrade, the county sheriff, who was allegedly involved in graft, prostitution, and bootlegging. In spite of its notoriety, the farmers' movement became one of the nation's most successful rural Communist organizations during the 1920s.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the beginning of the Depression decade, however, Communism in northeastern Montana was crippled. <i>The Red Corner</i> details this strange reversal of fortune by examining newspaper accounts, FBI reports, and internal Communist Party files, offering insights on how movements arise, sustain themselves, and decline.</p><p>With local savvy and the detective skills of a first-rate scholar, Verlaine Stoner McDonald splendidly recreates the "Red days" of radical politics in the Depression-hit farm country of northeasternmost Montana.

Just as surely, almost everyone who has heard these claims has ignored them&#x2014;the notion of a &#x201c;secret hand&#x201d; in world affairs is just too fantastic to believe. Yet, in 2008, the world witnessed a meltdown in world finances. By capitalist rules &#x201c;he who takes the risk earns the reward,&#x201d; but that is not how things occurred. The entire financial sector which had engaged in extreme risk for profit and lost, balked at the prospect of bankruptcy and exercised a hitherto unknown option (to the average western citizen at least) and socialized their losses, transferring them to the public ledger. This is not capitalism. If we are not in a capitalist system, what kind of system has developed? Perhaps we should examine the claims that there exists a &#x201c;New World Order&#x201d; in more detail and try once and for all to establish whether it really does exist. The present work examines the origin of World War I, the seminal event of the Twentieth Century and the event that &#x201c;made&#x201d; the New World Order under the leadership of Lord Milner. Lord Milner was an international banker and he worked closely with J. P. Morgan in the USA and Lord Rothschild and other bankers in the City of London. The central thesis of &#x201c;Lord Milner&#x2019;s Second War&#x201d; is that Lord Milner arranged for Britain to participate in the War. Cecil Rhodes, the great British Imperialist, wanted to establish a world state through the British Empire. He set up his secret society to achieve that goal and he groomed Lord Milner to succeed him. Milner started the South African War (the Boer War) to seize control of South Africa and its huge gold deposits. He pioneered the use of concentration camps to wage war on the civilian population. Twenty-seven-thousand Boer women and children perished in Milner&#x2019;s camps&#x2014;far more than the casualties of all combatants. Having hoisted the British flag on all of South Africa, Milner set his sights on the ultimate prize&#x2014;a great war that would crush Russia and Germany and leave his banking allies free to dominate world finances. The present work suggests that the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, The Secretary of War, Richard Haldane and the British Director of Military Operations, General Sir Henry Wilson forged the military arrangements with France that led Britain to war. But two of these men, Grey and Haldane, belonged to the Rhodes-Milner secret society, and the third, General Wilson, was a close associate of Lord Milner. &#x201c;Lord Milner&#x2019;s Second War&#x201d; outlines how this secret society directed British foreign policy to fomenting a European conflict. With patience and skill, Foreign Secretary Grey convinced France and Russia of Britain&#x2019;s genuine commitment to taking part in a European war. As a result, France and Russia became more aggressive in the Balkans. With the rise of President Poincar� of France, Sir Edward Grey at last had a French partner who unequivocally wanted war. Allied to Russian Ambassador Izvolsky, Poincar� and Grey arranged for Europe to plunge into the 1914-18 catastrophe. The First World War did not go as planned, but Milner won in the end with a lot of help from the American banking cartel, which arranged the extraordinary intervention of America. The Milner Group came out of World War I as the most powerful organization in the West. They had a major influence in starting World War II and they emerged from that war stronger than ever. After the Second World War, headquarters moved permanently to New York. Gradually the organization transformed itself into the New World Order and Bilderberg Group of the present. The New World Order is about to create a cashless society, the penultimate step to ushering in the absolute surveillance exercised by Orwell&#x2019;s &#x201c;Big Brother.&#x201d; &#x201c;Lord Milner&#x2019;s Second War&#x201d; has one purpose: to argue for the existence of the Milner Group and to introduce you to your enemy.</p><p>John Cafferky holds three degrees from Trinity College, Dublin. He spent ten years as chief geologist at the Agnico Eagle Mines, Joutel site, in northwestern Quebec where he helped discover, and bring into production, the Telbel mine. Currently he lives in Toronto and teaches mathematics. He has a passion for science, philosophy, history and writing. This is his third book. In his first book, Evolution&#x2019;s Hand, he examined the problems of evolution in the light of his Achaean rock experience in northern Canada. In his second book, Scandal and Betrayal, he investigated the mysterious disappearance of the Irish Crown Jewels in 1906, which was featured in a documentary on the subject. In his third book, Lord Milner&#x2019;s Second War, he argues that the First World War was fostered by an agreement between Russia, France and the Rhodes-Milner secret society of Great Britain. The secret society was a partnership of British imperialists and international financiers. It is this group that has given rise to the New World Order movement that has been highlighted by conspiracy theorists studying the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group. Lord Milner&#x2019;s Second War is a case study in conspiracy in which the question is posed: &#x201c;is there really an organized shadowy group directing major events?&#x201d; John Cafferky answers yes and reviews the evidence that led him to this conclusion.</p><h2>The Book of the Order of Chivalry</h2><p>Ramon Llull (1232-1316) composed The Book of the Order of Chivalry between 1274 and 1276 as both an instrument of reform and an agent for change. His aim was to create and codify the rules for a unilateral Order of Chivalry. Loyalty to the Order, coupled with common sense, religious faith, education, and martial prowess, were in his view the keys to victory in the Holy Land and the Reconquista. The book was an immediate success and widely disseminated across Europe, eventually reaching a medieval English audience, though through a fanciful translation of a translation by William Caxton, in which most of the stylistic nuances of the Catalan original were lost. This new translation is directly from the original Catalan, so capturing for the first time in English the concise, austere style that characterises Llull&#39;s prose; it is presented with introduction and notes. It will be essential reading for all scholars and enthusiasts of medieval chivalric culture.

To describe Fallow&#39;s translation as merely accessible and thus suited only for students, however, is to overlook what is a rigorous and scholarly translation. Indeed, Fallows succeeds in providing a translation that stays true to the original work and recaptures the essence of the author&#39;s original prose. THE MEDIEVAL REVIEW Fallows has done a fine job in this edition. The prose is straightforward and plain-spoken, easily understandable to a modern reader impatient with period flourishes. ... It&#39;s an accessible and valuable scholarly resource for fields as diverse as medieval philosophy and military history. COMITATUS (Provides) valuable insight into the mindset of the late Medieval knight and the expectations of Chivalric society. HISTORY OF WAR.ORG Over the centuries that it was read this brief book retained its relevance but how that applied must have changed and so Llull has provided even the modern reader with a lens through which to view the medieval world.

Yet the alignment of the skeleton along the vertical axis of gravity is largely overlooked today, even by fitness experts and yoga teachers. In a culture of cocked hips, sauntering models, and slouching TV watchers, where &#x201c;chin up, shoulders back, stomach in&#x201d; is believed to be good posture, we have forgotten what healthy alignment looks and feels like--leading to chronic neck, shoulder, and back pain for millions. <br> <br>Sharing photographs from around the world of &#x201c;gurus&#x201d; of natural posture and authentic strength, such as women in their 80s who easily carry heavy loads on their heads and toddlers learning to walk, Kathleen Porter shows what natural skeletal alignment truly looks like. With insights based on the fundamental laws of physics and detailed full-color diagrams, she guides you through an understanding of the body&#x2019;s naturally pain-free design. She explains that when the body is aligned as nature intended, your weight is supported by your bones rather than your muscles, allowing a blissful release from chronic muscular tension--which you may not even be aware you had. She offers 12 physical exercises to become mindful of your posture and discover healthy alignment of your pelvis, rib cage, shoulders, neck, and your body as a whole. <br> <br>Providing easy-to-follow instructions for mindful alignment during the most ordinary daily activities, even sleeping, as well as a chapter on practicing yoga safely, Porter shows how returning to our forgotten alignment from childhood can offer relief from chronic pain and tension and can provide easy flexibility, enduring strength, and vitality well into old age.</p><p>Kathleen Porter is the director of the Center for Natural Alignment in Portland, Oregon. She offers programs for people with posture-related pain and for children and teachers in classrooms. She has taught principles of natural alignment at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, the National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon, and the Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York. She lives in Portland, Oregon.<b>Chapter 1 <br>DESIGN FOR LIFE </b> <br> <br>Who is more fit? Is it a small woman with elastic muscles and naturally aligned bones or a much larger man with six-pack abs and firmly developed pecs, deltoids, and biceps? <br> <br>The small woman is able to carry heavy rocks on her head all day long, day after day, without strain. Because the weight of the load is distributed through aligned bones, the bones actually do the work of carrying the load. Her muscles are thus free to perform their primary job of moving the bones without strain. The musculoskeletal system functions as a dynamic interplay between bones and muscles that requires the bones to be <i>aligned</i> and the muscles to be <i>elastic</i>. This balanced interplay is the hallmark of true fitness. <br> <br>This man is clearly strong in ways the woman is not. His power lies within his muscles alone, not in an overall integrated whole of fully functioning parts. The popular culture of fitness today is partly based on the idea that developed muscles are a requirement. Unfortunately, muscles that have been developed in this way are storehouses of contracted tension, making it difficult for them to lengthen and relax. This type of strength must be worked at continuously and is dependent on a regular maintenance routine. This man&#x2019;s spine is shortened and compressed. His breathing is restricted because of a diaphragm that doesn&#x2019;t move in a natural, efficient way. The range of motion of his shoulders and hips is greatly restricted. It is ironic that the strength he has worked so hard to acquire has also become a type of weakness. <br> <br>The modern-day confusion about what constitutes authentic strength and natural, easy flexibility is at the root of most of the chronic pain experienced by millions of people every day. In the United States today, millions of people live with chronic aches and pain that severely limit their activities, affect their ability to work, cost them thousands of dollars in lost wages, and impair their enjoyment of life. Employers, insurance companies, and workers&#x2019; compensation funds pay billions of dollars each year for lost time on the job and benefits to injured employees. <br> <br><b>Unnatural strength</b> <br>- has its power in purposely developed muscles <br>- must be continuously worked at to be maintained <br>- limits the range of motion of the joints <br>- restricts elasticity of the diaphragm <br>- compresses the spine <br> <br><b>Natural strength</b> <br>- has its power in aligned bones <br>- is innate and reinforced in ordinary activities <br>- promotes natural, easy flexibility of joints <br>- elongates the spine <br> <br>Whether pain is chronic and low level or severe and debilitating, it has become an enormous problem in our country. In fact, pain is so common that it has come to be considered a normal fact of life. The epidemic of chronic pain has given way to a new medical specialty--<i>pain management</i>--because it is assumed that, in many cases, pain is something one simply must learn to live with. Too often pain management relies on the use of prescription drugs that generate billions of dollars in profits for pharmaceutical companies, while driving a crippling addiction problem for millions of Americans. <br> <br>The list of complaints is long and includes general unexplained lower back pain, hip and knee pain, arthritis, tendonitis, sciatica, fibromyalgia, plantar fasciitis, frozen shoulder, rotator cuff injury, herniated or bulging discs, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, spondylolesthesis, temporamandibular joint disorder (TMJ), and chronic tension in neck and shoulder muscles. Much of this pain appears to be <i>idiopathic</i>, meaning it has no clear, discernible cause, making it difficult for doctors to know how to treat it. When asked what caused their pain, people will often say things such as &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have lifted that box of books&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been running for twenty years, and my knees finally wore out&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not as young as I used to be.&#x201d; <br> <br>If any of these people knew what their bodies were actually telling them, they might respond with more accurate answers, such as &#x201c;Bending to lift a box of books, my pelvis was tucked under, causing my spine to round and preventing my core from stabilizing my spine. This forced my back to strain rather than being able to rely on aligned bones working with the strength of my legs and arms to do the work.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;Running for twenty years with misaligned bones has put persistent stress on my knees, causing the cartilage to wear out.&#x201d; Or possibly, &#x201c;This aging body is now paying the price for not living according to its natural design.&#x201d; <br> <br>It can be startling to discover that exercise in and of itself, and in spite of its obvious benefits, is seldom the solution for this kind of pain over the long run. In fact, because exercise can reinforce and embed unhelpful patterns of movement, it can, and often does, cause many people&#x2019;s pain in the first place. Eventually we all pay the price if our bones have not been able to do the job of supporting us throughout the years. <br> <br>Musculoskeletal pain is far less of a problem in some parts of the world, even in places where people do a lot of manual labor for years on end. The secret seems to be that some people never lose the biomechanical principles of the human design, something all healthy toddlers discover when first learning how to stand and walk. <br> <br>In our popular quest for fitness and a culturally imposed standard of beauty, many of us unwittingly disregard the importance of skeletal alignment and create conditions that compromise our long-term health. A misaligned skeleton causes muscles that attach to the skeleton to either shorten or lengthen unnaturally. This creates chronic tension that restricts mobility of certain joints. It also impairs breathing, compresses vertebrae, puts pressure on and distorts the spinal cord (the primary neural pathway), and affects circulation. It would be hard to argue with the fact that all of these factors have far-reaching consequences for one&#x2019;s health.</p><h2>Summa Theologiae Prima Pars, 1-49 (Latin-English Opera Omnia)</h2><p>The most important work of the towering intellectual of the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas&#39; Summa Theologiae remains one of the great seminal works of philosophy and theology, while extending to subjects as diverse as law and government, sacraments and liturgy, and psychology and ethics. Aquinas begins his famous Summa Theologiae by getting right to the heart of what every person longs to see: the face of God. With Latin and English side-by-side, this edition is perfect for students, teachers, pastors, or anyone wanting to have a deeper understanding of God.</p><p>An intellectual giant of the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas is best known for the clarity of thought in his philosophical and theological writings. His primary occupation at the University of Paris was as a theologian and a commentator on Sacred Scripture, and his philosophical work was always at the service of his Scriptural meditations. The writings of Thomas Aquinas remain widely influential to this day. &#x201c;In his thinking, the demands of reason and the power of faith found the most elevated synthesis ever attained by human thought.&#x201d; (John Paul II, Fides et Ratio)&#34;In order to study the magnum opus of the &#39;Dumb Ox&#39;, a learner wants the best resource, a reference edition that others versions will cite as their reference edition.

Huggins Lectures)</h2><p><p>As the United States gained independence, a full fifth of the country's population was African American. The experiences of these men and women have been largely ignored in the accounts of the colonies' glorious quest for freedom. In this compact volume, Gary B. Nash reorients our understanding of early America, and reveals the perilous choices of the founding fathers that shaped the nation's future. </p><p>Nash tells of revolutionary fervor arousing a struggle for freedom that spiraled into the largest slave rebellion in American history, as blacks fled servitude to fight for the British, who promised freedom in exchange for military service. The Revolutionary Army never matched the British offer, and most histories of the period have ignored this remarkable story. The conventional wisdom says that abolition was impossible in the fragile new republic. Nash, however, argues that an unusual convergence of factors immediately after the war created a unique opportunity to dismantle slavery. The founding fathers' failure to commit to freedom led to the waning of abolitionism just as it had reached its peak. In the opening decades of the nineteenth century, as Nash demonstrates, their decision enabled the ideology of white supremacy to take root, and with it the beginnings of an irreparable national fissure. The moral failure of the Revolution was paid for in the 1860s with the lives of the 600,000 Americans killed in the Civil War. </p><p><i>The Forgotten Fifth</i> is a powerful story of the nation's multiple, and painful, paths to freedom.</p></p><p>Gary B. Nash is Professor of History Emeritus, University of California, Los Angeles, and Professor and Director, National Center for History in the Schools.&#x201c;In this wonderfully detailed narrative, Gary Nash tells the dramatic and engaging story of African American people and the issues of race and slavery at a critical moment in American history. Marshaling compelling evidence, he illuminates the post-Revolutionary debates over slavery and abolition. Had the founders' actions matched their ideals of freedom, we might well have avoided a Civil War. An important book that offers profound insights into the foundations of the history of all Americans.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Oliver Horton and Lois E. Horton, co-authors of <i>Slavery and the Making of America</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gary Nash is one of America's most distinguished historians and he has done as much as anyone to bring 'The Forgotten Fifth' to life. With this incisive and engaging book, he compels Americans to learn more about a remarkable generation of black founders--men and women who helped shape the meaning of liberty and justice for all as surely as their better known counterparts, Jefferson, Washington and Madison. A fine book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard S. Newman, author of <i>The Transformation of American Abolitionism: Fighting Slavery in the Early Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gary Nash has long inspired all those still laboring to bring a missing portion of American history to light. In <i>The Forgotten Fifth,</i> Nash sketches a complex and gripping tale of a road not taken toward true equality at the time of our nation's founding. This veteran historian has placed squarely on the table the largest missing piece in the puzzle of our extraordinary revolution. Now the soul-searching debate about what this complex story means for all Americans can begin.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Wood, Duke University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Nash's reminder that African-Americans made up a fifth of the population during the Revolutionary era exemplifies the purpose of this lively, accessible 'corrective to historical amnesia,' comprising three discrete chapters based on lectures he delivered at Harvard in 2004. The wide-ranging first chapter, 'The Black Americans' Revolution,' illustrates how the War for Independence whetted slaves' thirst for freedom. Nash chronicles slave defection to the British (for whom many more blacks fought than for the Americans) and sketches vivid portraits of individuals who sued for their freedom in the courts. The impassioned second chapter asks, 'Could Slavery Have Been Abolished?' and argues the affirmative--that ending slavery during the postrevolutionary period was not only possible but would have unified rather than split the nation. Nash traces broad political and economic conditions (e.g., widespread abolitionist sentiment) to support his argument, and blames the nation's leaders and founding fathers for their lack of political courage. The concluding essay explores questions of citizenship and national identity through the early 19th-century writings of two contemporary Philadelphians, the African-American businessman James Forten and Tench Coxe, a white political economist. Nash exhibits gracefully assertive scholarship in this brief but meaty synthesis.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;During the American Revolution, one in every five Americans was black. The British offered freedom in return for joining the fight against the rebels. The Continental Army did not. In a slim but well-researched narrative, historian Nash questions the idea that slavery was an issue best deferred in the early days of the Republic.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bob Minzesheimer</b><b>, </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A book to stimulate robust debate, this one is well worth the read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Frank Lampert</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Historical Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This short book features three provocative essays based on the author's 2004 Nathan Huggins Lectures at Harvard.

Because, in Maxine's words: 'When freedom is the question, it is always time to begin.'"</strong></p> <p>In <em>The Dialectic of Freedom</em>, Maxine Greene argues that freedom must be achieved through continuing resistance to the forces that limit, condition, determine, and&#x2015;too frequently&#x2015;oppress. </p> <p>Examining the interrelationship between freedom, possibility, and imagination in American education, Greene taps the fields of philosophy, history, educational theory, and literature in order to discuss the many struggles that have characterized Americans&#x2019; quests for freedom in the midst of what is conceived to be a free society. Accounts of the lives of women, immigrants, and minority groups highlight the ways in which Americans have gone in search of openings in their lived situations, learned to look at things as if they could be otherwise, and taken action on what they found. </p> <p>Greene presents a unique overview of American concepts and images of freedom from Jefferson&#x2019;s time to the present. She examines the ways in which the disenfranchised have historically understood and acted on their freedom&#x2015;or lack of it&#x2015;in dealing with perceived and real obstacles to expression and empowerment. Strong emphasis is placed on the focal role of the arts and art experience in releasing human imagination and enabling the young to reach toward their vision of the possible. </p> <p>The author concludes with suggestions for approaches to teaching and learning that can provoke both educators and students to take initiatives, to transcend limits, and to pursue freedom&#x2015;not in solitude, but in reciprocity with others, not in privacy, but in a public space.</p></p><p><p><br> "Why now, you may ask, should I return to a book written in 1988?

This book aims to give a clear and readable overview of his philosophical work. It analyzes both the theoretical underpinnings of Habermas's social theory, and its more concrete applications in the fields of ethics, politics, and law. Finally, it examines how Habermas's social and political theory informs his writing on real, current political and social problems. The author explores Habermas's influence on a wide variety of fields--including philosophy, political and social theory, cultural studies, sociology, and literary studies. He uses a problem-based approach to explain how Habermas's ideas can be applied to actual social and political situations. The book also includes a glossary of technical terms to further acquaint the reader with Habermas's philosophy.

Less well known is that other countries have experienced "rights revolutions" as well. Charles R. Epp argues that, far from being the fruit of an activist judiciary, the ascendancy of civil rights and liberties has rested on the democratization of access to the courts&#x2014;the influence of advocacy groups, the establishment of governmental enforcement agencies, the growth of financial and legal resources for ordinary citizens, and the strategic planning of grass roots organizations.

Schneier uses his extensive field experience with his own clients to dispel the myths that often mislead IT managers as they try to build secure systems. This practical guide provides readers with a better understanding of why protecting information is harder in the digital world, what they need to know to protect digital information, how to assess business and corporate security needs, and much more.<br> * Walks the reader through the real choices they have now for digital security and how to pick and choose the right one to meet their business needs<br> * Explains what cryptography can and can't do in achieving digital security</p><p>Whom can you trust? Try Bruce Schneier, whose rare gift for common sense makes his book <i>Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World</i> both enlightening and practical. He's worked in cryptography and electronic security for years, and has reached the depressing conclusion that even the loveliest code and toughest hardware still will yield to attackers who exploit human weaknesses in the users. The book is neatly divided into three parts, covering the turn-of-the-century landscape of systems and threats, the technologies used to protect and intercept data, and strategies for proper implementation of security systems. Moving away from blind faith in prevention, Schneier advocates swift detection and response to an attack, while maintaining firewalls and other gateways to keep out the amateurs.<p> Newcomers to the world of Schneier will be surprised at how funny he can be, especially given a subject commonly perceived as quiet and dull. Whether he's analyzing the security issues of the rebels and the Death Star in <i>Star Wars</i> or poking fun at the giant software and e-commerce companies that consistently sacrifice security for sexier features, he's one of the few tech writers who can provoke laughter consistently. While moderately pessimistic on the future of systems vulnerability, he goes on to relieve the reader's tension by comparing our electronic world to the equally insecure paper world we've endured for centuries--a little smart-card fraud doesn't seem so bad after all. Despite his unfortunate (but brief) shill for his consulting company in the book's afterword, you can trust Schneier to dish the dirt in <i>Secrets and Lies</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>More Reviews <p>"As a thoughtful read, prior to planning or reviewing your business's security strategy, you could not do better...."

Excited and even somewhat amazed by the Value of Debt--how to strategically use one's Indebted Strengths to be in a much better long-term position--I have been asked many times for a detailed treatment of these ideas.<br><br>Well, I looked high and low, both online and offline, and couldn't find one, so I felt that given the incredible value that people are already finding in these ideas, I would go ahead and take the plunge and do my best to write it all up in an easy-to-understand book (although you will still need--and most certainly will want--the help of the right financial advisor to fully understand or implement any specific actions).<br><br>Structurally the book starts out by laying the foundation for a solid strategic debt philosophy. It then transitions to understanding a key building block, which is the incredible benefit of having an Asset Based Loan Facility at your disposal. With these tools in place, I then explore scenarios for success and present specific case studies.<br><br>A solid foundation is essential to all things in life, but is particularly necessary with respect to formulating and implementing a strategic debt philosophy. I would encourage you to not skip ahead to the case studies regardless of your level of education or familiarity with the subject.<br><br>Case studies are complicated in book such as this. The material is difficult to understand without examples but there is risk that somebody could look at a simple example and try to apply that to their complex life. Individual situations are unique and multifaceted. It is worth noting that all case studies presented in this book are for educational and illustrative purposes only and should be used to help trigger meaningful conversations with your advisors about your individual situation. They cannot be - and are not intended to be - advice that you can directly apply to your situation. There are many risks to these ideas and of course all loans are subject to eligibility and approval by the lender.<br><br>Because of the risks involved I can't stress enough the importance of reading the appendices, end notes, stress testing your philosophy, and becoming as prepared as possible for a wide range of outcomes. Moreover, never underestimate the importance, necessity, and value of working with an outstanding group of professional advisors to implement these ideas according to your individual needs, goals, financial condition, and risk tolerance.<br><br>Some readers will undoubtedly desire more detail than a book such as this can provide while still be appealing to general readers. If you have an academic or financial background, you will find that this book's theoretical basis can be found in finance and accounting materials that are taught in graduate and undergraduate business courses throughout the world. You may also recognize that several of the most famous theories in finance are directly or indirectly referenced. In order to keep the material appealing to readers of all levels, however, most technical finance references have been placed in the endnotes.<br><br>A quick note on interest rates and the global economy will also be helpful at this point. The ideas expressed in this book are designed to transcend political borders and to transcend time. Clearly, over multiple countries and multiple economic conditions, the range of outcomes we will see in our lifetimes may be vast. In the text I use interest rates that represent the current economic environment, but these ideas could have been applied equally in 1980. I've done my best to be world neutral, but there are a number of U.S. specific references, particularly as to taxes. The vast majority of these ideas can be applied around the world in virtually any economy.<br><br>I hope you find a great deal of value in these pages and that they inspire you to create and implement your own strategic debt philosophy.<br><br>-- Tom Anderson<p>Virtually every CFO of a large company recognizes that both assets and debts can be sources of financial strength. Yet the vast majority of high-net-worth individuals are either perilously over-leveraged or, more commonly, tragically under-leveraged.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking book, author Tom Anderson argues that, despite the reflex aversion most people have to debt--an aversion that is vociferously preached by most personal finance authors--wealthy individuals and families, as well as their financial advisors, have everything to gain and nothing to lose by learning to think holistically about debt, the way CFOs do.</p> <p>Viewing amortization as the enemy of good financial sense, with only a few notable exceptions, Anderson explains why, if strategically deployed, debt can be of enormous long-term benefit in the management of individual and family wealth. More importantly, he schools you in time-tested strategies for using debt to steadily build wealth, to generate tax-efficient retirement income, to provide a reliable source of funds in times of crisis and financial setback, and more.</p> <p>Taking a Strategic Debt approach to personal wealth management, he emphasizes the need to appreciate the value of "Indebted Strengths" and for acquiring the tools needed to take advantage of those strengths for increased liquidity, flexibility, leverage, and survivability.</p> <p>But, as he explains, before you can begin to leverage your indebted strengths, you must first determine your optimal debt ratio, or what he refers to as your debt "sweet spot." To that end, he describes methods CFOs use to determine their companies' debt sweet spots, and he shows you how to apply those methods in finding yours.</p> <p>Anderson then supplies you with a set of advanced techniques for leveraging your indebted strengths, including: </p> <ul> <li>Capturing the spread, or, in other words, profiting from the difference between the value of an investment and cost of the debt incurred to make it</li> <li>A discussion on second homes (including renting versus buying) and a framework for how much of a second home you can afford (and how much of it should be financed)</li> <li>Better ways to purchase and finance cars, boats, and luxury items</li> <li>How you can help your children and grandchildren by using your balance sheet</li> <li>How access to the right kind of debt can help you and your family be better prepared for an emergency</li> <li>The best way to do eldercare transitions including bridge loans for you or someone in your family</li> <li>Alternative means of financing home improvements, college, real estate, raw land, and business investments</li> <li>Ways to create tax-favored income in retirement and divorce</li> </ul> <p>In <i>The Value of Debt</i>, Anderson proves that all else being equal, a lower volatility portfolio with some debt is better than a high-volatility portfolio with no debt. He also takes a balanced approach and has an in-depth discussion of the risks inherent in this strategy. This includes an overview of the different economic environments we could face and base case scenarios that all investors should be aware of.</p> <p>In addition, on <i>The Value of Debt</i> companion website you'll find a proprietary tool for calculating your own optimal debt ratio. With inputs for assets and liabilities, it enables you to develop your personal wealth balance sheet and to compare it to examples provided by the author.</p> <p>Offering a bold new vision of debt as a strategic asset in the management of individual and family wealth, <i>The Value of Debt</i> is an important resource for financial advisors, wealthy families, family offices, and professional investors.</p></p><h2>A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century</h2><p>Natural philosophy encompassed all natural phenomena of the physical world. It sought to discover the physical causes of all natural effects and was little concerned with mathematics. By contrast, the exact mathematical sciences were narrowly confined to various computations that did not involve physical causes, functioning totally independently of natural philosophy. Although this began slowly to change in the late Middle Ages, a much more thoroughgoing union of natural philosophy and mathematics occurred in the seventeenth century and thereby made the Scientific Revolution possible. The title of Isaac Newton&#39;s great work, The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, perfectly reflects the new relationship. Natural philosophy became the &#39;Great Mother of the Sciences&#39;, which by the nineteenth century had nourished the manifold chemical, physical, and biological sciences to maturity, thus enabling them to leave the &#39;Great Mother&#39; and emerge as the multiplicity of independent sciences we know today.</p><p>Natural philosophy encompassed all natural phenomena of the physical world. This book describes how, in the seventeenth century, natural philosophy and the exact mathematical sciences were joined together to make the Scientific Revolution possible and lay the foundations for the emergence of numerous modern sciences in the nineteenth century.Edward Grant is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of the History and Philosophy of Science at Indiana University, Bloomington. He is the author and editor of twelve books, including God and Reason in the Middle Ages (Cambridge, 2001), and The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts (Cambridge, 1996).

In other words, it focuses on research-based findings and up-to-date applications that help increase an organization s talent pool. Performance management is ongoing and cyclical; however, for pedagogical reasons, the book needs to follow a linear structure. Because performance observation, evaluation, and improvement are ongoing processes, some concepts and practices may be introduced early in a cursory manner, but receive more detailed treatment in later sections. In addition, many issues such as training of raters and employee development will be discussed in multiple chapters. So, you will see that several chapters may refer to similar issues. When this happens, content included in more than one chapter will be cross-referenced. Finally, this book focuses on best practices and describes the necessary steps to create a top-notch performance management system. As a result of practical constraints and lack of knowledge about system design and implementation, many organizations cut corners and do not have systems that follow best practices. Environmental and political issues (e.g., goals of raters may not be aligned with goals of the organization) also play a role. Because the way in which systems are implemented in practice is often not close to the ideal system, the book includes numerous examples from actual organizations to illustrate how systems are implemented, given actual situational constraints.</p><p>Dr. Herman Aguinis is the Avram Tucker Distinguished Scholar and Professor of Management at George Washington University School of Business.

Very few such efforts pay serious attention to the role of religion and spirituality in the lives of American adolescents. But many teenagers are very involved in religion. Surveys reveal that 35% attend religious services weekly and another 15% attend at least monthly. 60% say that religious faith is important in their lives. 40% report that they pray daily. 25% say that they have been "born again." Teenagers feel good about the congregations they belong to. Some say that faith provides them with guidance and resources for knowing how to live well. What is going on in the religious and spiritual lives of American teenagers? What do they actually believe? What religious practices do they engage in? Do they expect to remain loyal to the faith of their parents? Or are they abandoning traditional religious institutions in search of a new, more authentic "spirituality"? This book attempts to answer these and related questions as definitively as possible. It reports the findings of The National Study of Youth and Religion, the largest and most detailed such study ever undertaken. The NYSR conducted a nationwide telephone survey of teens and significant caregivers, as well as nearly 300 in-depth face-to-face interviews with a sample of the population that was surveyed. The results show that religion and spirituality are indeed very significant in the lives of many American teenagers. Among many other discoveries, they find that teenagers are far more influenced by the religious beliefs and practices of their parents and caregivers than commonly thought. They refute the conventional wisdom that teens are "spiritual but not religious." And they confirm that greater religiosity is significantly associated with more positive adolescent life outcomes. This eagerly-awaited volume not only provides an unprecedented understanding of adolescent religion and spirituality but, because teenagers serve as bellwethers for possible future trends, it affords an important and distinctive window through which to observe and assess the current state and future direction of American religion as a whole.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christian Smith</strong> is the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Sociology at the University of Notre Dame, Director of the Center for the Sociology of Religion and Society, and Principal Investigator of the National Study of Youth and Religion. He is the author of <em>Moral, Believing Animals</em> (OUP, 2003), co-author of <em>Divided by Faith</em> (OUP, 2000) and the co-author of the forthcoming <em>Passing the Plate</em> (OUP).<br> <strong>Melinda Lundquist Denton</strong> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at Clemson University.<br>Any parent with a conscience who is raising a teenager will read these two books and immediately fall to her knees at the altar before God, Yahweh, Jesus, Muhammad -- nearly any recognizable deity will do -- and hope her children follow suit. Neither of these is remotely a parenting book, but the evidence they compile about American teenagers is pretty stark. Kids who describe themselves as religious are less likely to cut classes, do drugs, have sex, get depressed, feel alone or misunderstood, talk back to their parents, lie. Practically the only thing they score higher on is feeling guilty if they fail to do the right thing. Apparently it doesn't just take a village; it takes a congregation. <p>Those findings are from Soul Searching, the final report of the National Study of Youth and Religion. Christian Smith, a widely respected sociologist at the University of North Carolina, conducted the study as the first comprehensive survey of the spiritual life of American teenagers. Occasionally Smith and his fellow researchers arranged in-depth interviews with some of the subjects, using pseudonyms. "Joy's" view of religion is: "People believe what they want to believe and if they get something out of that, then that's what they should believe." Joy drinks and does drugs, but her parents don't know because "my parents don't know me that well." She has a 23-year-old boyfriend and a best friend who tried to kill himself. In contrast, "Kristen," as a young child, found her father's body after he'd shot himself; but then her mother taught her that God is "father to the fatherless," and at 16 she still deeply believes it. She's never tried drugs or alcohol; she's active in her church youth group. Sometimes she thinks she might keep a secret from her mom, "but then it all comes out." As for her friends who experiment and see R-rated movies, "They're the ones missing out," she says. Now, which child would you rather raise?</p><p>Skip Kristen forward three years and you have the characters that populate God on the Quad, a survey of the nation's 700 religious colleges with a focus on the most devout ones. Naomi Schaefer Riley opens her book with a pair of preconceptions: Secular schools are havens for goofy vegetarians and transgendered politics; floating above this mess is what she calls the "missionary generation," the 1.3 million graduates of religious colleges who reject sex outside marriage, drugs, homosexual relationships, a "spiritually empty education" and the "sophisticated ennui of their contemporaries." So it's no surprise that her survey goes on to find just that: smart, ambitious, God-fearing coeds. They are slightly defensive about the fact that, say, Bob Jones University had a longtime ban on interracial marriage or that the students at Brigham Young University still follow restrictive Mormon dating rituals. But they are basically happy and confident and, most important, they seem totally normal, the kind of graduates any employer would be proud to hire.</p><p>The premise of the book is that religious colleges are trying a grand experiment: They don't want to send their graduates out into the Christian ghetto; more than ever, they want to "give their students . . . the tools to succeed in the secular world and the strength to do so without compromising their faith." They want to produce students who can compete with Ivy Leaguers for consulting jobs at McKinsey and, when they get there, ace the in-house ethics exam. Riley assumes these young people will thrive, but the best parts of the book are those in which she examines the many tensions inherent in the marriage of a fundamentalist faith and a broad intellect.</p><p>At Thomas Aquinas College, a sort of pre-seminary in Southern California, Riley presses a tutor on whether teaching Nietzsche won't make students doubt the existence of God. The tutor gives a somewhat smug answer, explaining that the college doesn't view education as intellectual sparring about fundamental questions; rather, doubt is, as Riley understands her, "a necessary evil in the process to saving souls." Riley doesn't press her any further, but still the question is out there: Can you expand minds and teach heresy without it ever taking root? A professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university, complains that parents won't let their children marry young, which creates a "moral disaster," meaning the students have sex outside marriage. His complaint raises another fundamental question: Is it possible to live an essentially 19th-century lifestyle (chaperones, no sex before marriage, teenage weddings) and keep up with 21st-century ambitions?</p><p>The chapter on the Jewish Yeshiva University in New York captures the tension most vividly. The school's secular teachers and its rabbis sneer at one another across a great divide. The rabbis complain that the secular teachers use Christian themes in their classes; the secular teachers complain that strict Judaism is "pass�." They fight over Israel, American politics, kosher pizza. The school produces most of the nation's rabbis, yet the new president is not one, and the religious half of the faculty worries he'll secularize the school; the religious students complain because a new French teacher wears low-cut blouses. The chapter ends with the mystery of "what is an educated Jew." </p><p>But outside the rarefied atmosphere of religious schools these extremes turn out to be pretty unusual -- just as, reading deeper in Soul Searching, one discovers that Joy and Kristen are atypical. Only a small slice of teenagers is as devoted as Kristen or as lost as Joy. Most fall into the vast foggy middle where God is some dude you heard about in, uhhm, some youth group your parents made you go to one time and He can help you out with anything, like, if you can't figure out whether to skip a test one Friday you should just ask Him. Here is one sample transcript: "What is God like?" asks the interviewer.</p><p>" 'Um. Good. Powerful.'</p><p>" 'Okay, anything else?' </p><p>" 'Tall.' " </p><p> Later: " 'What good has God done in your life?' </p><p>" 'I, well, I have a house, parents, I have the internet, I have a phone, I have cable.' " </p><p>This, in a snapshot, is the real American teenager the book depicts. He is neither on fire for God nor a drug addict. She is neither the avid spiritual seeker nor the secret Wiccan portrayed in popular culture. She turns out to be, on the whole, pretty conventional, following whatever religious practices her parents have introduced her to and not thinking too deeply about them. His sense of morality is not really rooted, and so is subject to whim. You shouldn't kill or steal from someone, one of them says, because it will "ruin their day." Fundamentally, her philosophy is: "Who am I to judge?" or "If that's what they choose, whatever." He is, as the clearly exasperated researchers write, "incredibly inarticulate." As one teen who inspires a subchapter and possibly a generational motto declares: "I believe there is a God and stuff." </p><p>Reviewed by Hanna Rosin <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

This book introduces students to the study of human rights and aims to build on their interest while simultaneously offering an alternative vision of the subject. Many texts focus on the theoretical and legal issues surrounding human rights. This book adopts a substantially different approach which uses empirical data derived from research on human rights by political scientists to illustrate the occurrence of different types of human rights violations across the world. The authors devote attention to rights as well as to responsibilities, neither of which stops at one country&#39;s political borders. They also explore how to deal with repression and the aftermath of human rights violations, making students aware of the prospects for and realities of progress.</p><p>A cutting-edge textbook analysing where and why human rights are violated. Adopting a unique empirical approach, The Politics of Human Rights provides a different slant to the theoretical approaches of other texts and directly challenges many of the previously unquestioned assumptions concerning human rights.Sabine C.

He proposes that the Pentateuch can be read as the earliest prescription on record for the establishment of an egalitarian polity. What emerges is the blueprint for a society that would stand in stark contrast to the surrounding cultures of the ancient Near East -- Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and the Hittite Empire - in which the hierarchical structure of the polity was centered on the figure of the king and his retinue. Berman shows that an egalitarian ideal is articulated in comprehensive fashion in the Pentateuch and is expressed in its theology, politics, economics, use of technologies of communication, and in its narrative literature. Throughout, he invokes parallels from the modern period as heuristic devices to illuminate ancient developments. Thus, for example, the constitutional principles in the Book of Deuteronomy are examined in the light of those espoused by Montesquieu, and the rise of the novel in 18th-century England serves to illuminate the advent of new modes of storytelling in biblical narrative.<br></p><p>&#34;Joshua Berman has written a superb, scholarly and paradigm-shifting work on the Hebrew Bible as perhaps the first attempt to create a truly egalitarian society. I can think of no better way of renewing our encounter with the biblical text, and I commend it highly.<br>Joshua A.

Both his presence on the island and his absence from the continent have stirred old enemies to realize new opportunities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Old hatreds. Old grudges. Old ambitions.<br> &nbsp;<br> The situation has strengthened the determination of power-seekers on both sides of the strait. Bren knows most of them very well, but not all of them well enough. The space station on which the world increasingly relies is desperate to get more supplies up to orbit and to get a critical oversupply of human refugees down to the world below. Rationing is in force on the station, but the overpopulation problem has to be solved quickly&#x2014;and Bren's mission on Mospheira has expanded to include preparation for that landing.<br> &nbsp;<br> First down will be the three children to whom Tabini's son has a close connection. But following them will be thousands of humans who have never set foot on a planet, humans descended from colonists and officers who split off from Mospheiran humans two hundred years before in a bitter parting of the ways. There is no way the <i>atevi</i>, native to the world, will cede any more land to these new arrivals: they will have to share the island. But certain Mospheirans are willing to use force to prevent these refugees from settling among them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bren's job is as general peacemaker&#x2014;but old enemies want war. Is Bren's diplomatic acumen enough to prevent a war that both sides are prepared to wage?</p><p>SFWA Grand Master <b>C.J. Cherryh</b> has written more than seventy books, including the highly popular Foreigner science fiction series. She won the Hugo Award for her novels <i>Downbelow Station</i> and <i>Cyteen</i>, and her short story "Cassandra." She has also won the Campbell Award, Locus Award, and more.1 <br> &nbsp;<br> The rainy day in Port Jackson brought a cool breeze from the open balcony doors. It was quite a lovely balcony, though Bren Cameron&#x2019;s atevi security, watching from across the room, didn&#x2019;t want him to cross that threshold. <br> &nbsp;<br> The doorway, however&#x2014;theirs being a third-floor suite in an isolated mansion on the highest hill in town&#x2014;still afforded a spectacular view of the city, and Bren stood leaning on the door frame, enjoying the moving air. Tall buildings of the present century stood on the right and left. The lower rooftops of the gracious old homes and shops of the prior century barely showed below, descending toward the harbor, with a wide gray gap. One couldn&#x2019;t quite see the harbor from here, but the center of that gap was the sea&#x2014;the strait that divided the human island of Mospheira from the vast megacontinent that belonged to the atevi, the world&#x2019;s native inhabitants. <br> &nbsp;<br> Bren&#x2019;s brother Toby was out there on his boat, possibly the safest man on the planet, anchored as he was next to an atevi naval vessel. In his own way, Toby had become as much a bridge between human and atevi, as Bren himself. Toby had carried secure messages both ways across that strait during the Trou�bles on the mainland, and more than once provided a quiet and safe passage for people and goods, the most recent being his delivery of Bren and his entourage to the island. <br> &nbsp;<br> Bren&#x2019;s work here was, technically, complete. He&#x2019;d made his reports, convinced the necessary officials that the answer to the overpopulation in the station orbiting above was to get the ref�ugees from Reunion Station down to the world and integrate them into Mospheiran society. More, he&#x2019;d set the right people into place to accomplish that deceptively difficult task. <br> &nbsp;<br> Only one job remained, and that was to be here when the next shuttle landed&#x2014;to greet the three young people so singu�larly important to the aiji&#x2019;s son, Cajeiri, and to see to their safe and secure settlement into their new life. <br> &nbsp;<br> That, however...was still days ahead. And meanwhile&#x2014;Bren and his bodyguard remained out of touch with the main�land, cut off from information, more isolated from doings over there than they had been on the space station. A phone call could reach the station. He had that, which could inform him on doings up there, and he could ask what the station knew&#x2014;but the station itself would have nothing on the things that worried him. If it had&#x2014;it might have called him. But it had not. <br> &nbsp;<br> Toby might know something. A single call right now, and Toby would come into that harbor. Toby might not speak that much Ragi, but he could at least ask the naval escort for news&#x2014;if the navy itself was told anything beyond its mission, which was to keep Toby safe, to keep one Bren Cameron safe, when he chose to come back across the strait&#x2014;and to provide the human government of Mospheira a visible earnest of the attention of the aishidi&#x2019;tat, the Western Association, which was to say, the government of the mainland. <br> &nbsp;<br> That was the outward face: the aishidi&#x2019;tat is watching. The paidhi-aiji has the aiji&#x2019;s strong support in his presentations, and in his demands. <br> &nbsp;<br> But there had been no word about goings-on inside the aishidi&#x2019;tat, nothing to explain the uncommon goings-on around Cajeiri, the unprecedented appearance by the nine-year-old heir, not just on atevi national television, but feeding over to the is�land as well. The aiji&#x2019;s family simply did <i>not </i>appear on camera, but there had been the aiji&#x2019;s nine-year-old son boarding the train, talking about a visit to his great-uncle Tatiseigi. Alone&#x2014;give or take his bodyguard. No sign of the aiji-dowager, who ordinarily would have been with him. Not going <i>with </i>Lord Ta�tiseigi, but going alone to visit him&#x2014;when Lord Tatiseigi had been under strong pressure by his own party. Conservatives were trying to throw their weight around now that other crises had, in their opinion, abated. Had they gotten the old man that upset? <br> &nbsp;<br> Other crises were <i>not </i>that abated. And the Conservatives getting their way could bring one of those crises alive, with all that went with it. <br> &nbsp;<br> They had just saved the planet from calamity, for God&#x2019;s sake. Could the Conservatives not let the situation lie quiet for a season? <br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately&#x2014;Tabini-aiji himself would not. Tabini had presented the Conservatives new worries. A treaty with an alien power? That didn&#x2019;t greatly concern them. The fact that two Conservative lordships lay fallow with the next legislative session looming, and Tabini was proposing to fund the landing of more humans from the heavens, to land at their own space�port, while the aiji was flinging precious cargo down from the station to light gods-knew-where on the hallowed soil of the mainland? They were upset. They had harried Tatiseigi to help them fill at least one of the vacant lordships, and get back a vote that could possibly slow Tabini&#x2019;s plans. <br> &nbsp;<br> Tabini had made a countermove. The nine-year-old heir had just been moved into public view, sent to bolster his great-uncle, with the aiji-dowager, his usual guardian, nowhere in sight? <br> &nbsp;<br> What was he up to? <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>God</i>, he wanted information. <br> &nbsp;<br> But calling Toby in just brought too much attention to Toby, the phones were absolutely not to be trusted, even if they spoke Ragi, and focusing the Mospheiran news agencies onto events on the mainland, at a time when focus on the next shuttle land�ing best served the <i>Mospheiran </i>political process...and the fu�ture of five thousand human refugees...<br> &nbsp;<br> No. His need to know was not paramount. His finishing his job here was. A good appearance, a good impression, and fo�cusing Mospheira on its own peaceful future&#x2014;that was the best use of the paidhi-aiji. The agreements had to be kept, for the sake of the refugees, and for the stability of the aishidi&#x2019;tat. Tabini-aiji did not commit himself to unprecedented favors and then have the recipients decide they&#x2019;d changed their minds. <br> &nbsp;<br> Banichi came to stand by him companionably&#x2014;senior of his aishid, black-skinned, golden-eyed, a head and shoulders taller than a tall human and wearing a uniform, Guild black, that he&#x2019;d likely worn every day since he was a teenager. Banichi was likely asking himself what the paidhi found out there of such interest, given a misting rain and an impenetrable gray in the direction of the homeland. <br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;d been together long enough, however, that Banichi needn&#x2019;t even ask the question. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am remembering the city,&#x201d; Bren answered. &#x201c;I wonder how my brother is faring out there on the water, and what he knows that we do not.&#x201d; Two questions begged the felicitous number, three, to settle the universe in order. &#x201c;I wonder why the young gentleman is traveling alone. And I am becoming very anxious to be home.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Home. It was curious to stand here on the island of his birth and say that, but it was true. Beyond any doubt he had had left, it was true. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We might have flown,&#x201d; Banichi said. &#x201c;We still might, at any hour, and easily return to Mospheira for the landing.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We might have,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We might. But one hesitates to excite the news folk with distracting questions. I take it there is no news from the mainland?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Banichi said. Guild communication was neces�sarily by radio, secure in its codes, but apt to raise curiosity when used here, and scant of the very sort of detail they might most want to know. &#x201c;We have indicated our concern. We have communicated with the aiji.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;And I dare not.&#x201d; There were phones&#x2014;but phone service to the mainland involved the Messengers&#x2019; Guild, which was not to be relied upon, even yet. There was also, somewhat more secure than what passed via the Messengers&#x2019; Guild, a commu�nication link via Lord Geigi&#x2019;s office up on the station. But Geigi had thus far sent them nothing regarding any problem. <br> And if he did involve himself in something the aiji had not seen fit to communicate to him, he could be seen as putting himself in play, which could ratchet up a situation on the main�land that they, crux of his problem, imperfectly understood. Quiet on this side of the straits served one interest; quiet on the other presumably served the aiji, or the aiji would have said something. <br> He had not gotten a call from Tabini-aiji&#x2014;only one from his own apartment staff, that had been far from clear. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your aishid has a theory,&#x201d; Banichi said, &#x201c;regarding the mes�sage from staff.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> He looked at Banichi, all attention. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Staff said,&#x201d; Banichi said, &#x201c;that &#x2018;uncle,&#x2019; which has to be Lord Tatiseigi, has found a &#x2018;replacement.&#x2019; Replacement for what, we ask. We imagine two possibilities. One, that Lord Tatiseigi has declared his own heir, a successor for the Atageini Clan. This would be a great relief, but would not bear on our business here, and it would not be something for staff to mention to you under these circumstances&#x2014;unless the chosen heir were the young gentleman; and that certainly cannot be the case. The situation is likeliest that the Conservatives are stirring to life, and that the aiji has sent his son to keep <i>them </i>at bay&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> That certainly made sense. For other lords to call on Tatiseigi at home while he was hosting the aiji&#x2019;s son as his guest would be a serious breach of protocol. The aiji-dowager as a guest would bring Conservatives flocking to the doorstep: she was political to the hilt. But the boy, a minor child? Absolutely the opposite. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But this replacement,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2014;is puzzling,&#x201d; Banichi said. &#x201c;We do not think this was on the horizon when the aiji made his plans. We take it to mean that Lord Tatiseigi has, in fact, named a <i>viable </i>candidate for the Ajuri lordship.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is not tradition <i>against </i>his nominating again?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Absolutely against it. Therefore we think, granted he has made such a move, that this must be a significant candidate. The Conservatives pressed him hard to make a serious nomina�tion before the upcoming session; and he deliberately chose from the bottom of the Conservatives&#x2019; list in absolute confi�dence that Tabini-aiji would veto it. We surmise he exercised that veto with fair rapidity, in fairness to the person thus named. Now if Lord Tatiseigi has, in fact, broken tradition to name another candidate, something has changed, and by all we can determine, the young gentleman is still <i>with </i>him, while the aiji-dowager is still at the opposite end of the continent&#x2014;so she is not likely the source of the candidate.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you <i>sure </i>where she is?&#x201d; Ilisidi was the one individual who could move Tatiseigi to make a radical change, and she had a habit of being wherever her great-grandchild was. When she was not&#x2014;it was worrisome. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are quite sure. She has not budged from Malguri. She went there deliberately to quiet the Conservatives and keep them away from Lord Tatiseigi, and whatever has happened since, she has not acted.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> The dowager <i>was </i>a conservative power. So was Tatiseigi. But the dowager&#x2019;s presence in any situation suggested to observers that whatever happened was her idea, and that assumption only complicated a complex maneuver. Tatiseigi&#x2019;s move did seem to be his own, regarding a Padi Valley situation, in which the dow�ager was an outsider, an Easterner, whose presence in western politics was problematic. The Conservatives were desperate to restore a vital, traditionally conservative Padi Valley lordship <i>before </i>the next legislative session. With <i>two </i>Padi Valley seats vacant, both Ajuri and Kadagidi, both neighbors to Tatiseigi, with Tatiseigi himself heirless and elderly, and with, in the Conservatives&#x2019; view, a very critical legislative session looming, the Conservatives wanted something done about the vacancies. Fast. <br> &nbsp;<br> There were problems with that haste&#x2014; ne of which was that there were so few candidates of the traditional bloodlines left alive. Ajuri clan had killed off <i>its </i>eligibles, and all the eligibles in Kadagidi clan were under taint of legal action. The aiji-consort was eligible for Ajuri, but by no means would Tabini have his wife take that post. Damiri&#x2019;s children were both eligi�ble, but one was Cajeiri, Tabini&#x2019;s nine-year-old heir, and the other was a babe in arms, so it could not be either of them. It was a potentially lethal honor, if one went strictly on history. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who would be eligible?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;More to the point, who would <i>want </i>it?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have compiled a very short list, but we cannot reconcile any of those with such a change of mind, not from Lord Tati�seigi. Certainly the acting lord would never have Tatiseigi&#x2019;s ap�proval.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or the aiji&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Bren said. The acting lord was Cajeiri&#x2019;s great-aunt Geidaro, a detestable woman&#x2014;and possibly complicit in the murder of the last lord, Cajeiri&#x2019;s grandfather. Oh, wouldn&#x2019;t solid proof of <i>that </i>misdeed make life easier for everyone? <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The aiji has reinforced the young gentleman&#x2019;s bodyguard, which we knew he would do soon. We attributed the intent to the young gentleman&#x2019;s new status as heir. However, in that the aiji has both attached that guard and sent the young gentleman under these circumstances&#x2014;we are reasonably confident the young gentleman&#x2019;s presence has political purpose. Now&#x2014;we ask ourselves whether <i>Tabini-aiji </i>may have asked Tatiseigi to make some specific move, and arranged the dowager&#x2019;s absence and the heir&#x2019;s presence in order for him to nominate outside the bloodline.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> That was about as convolute a piece of politics as one could imagine. The conservative dowager was not inclined to step aside on request, and the other One cannot envision the aiji dropping his son this deep into Padi Valley politics.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One cannot envision it,&#x201d; Banichi said. &#x201c;Which leaves us to imagine that whatever is going on in Lord Tatiseigi&#x2019;s house was not in the plan, and that something has come up rapidly since the heir&#x2019;s arrival.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What could? Lord Tatiseigi&#x2019;s health?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If <i>he </i>were ill, or if there were any crisis with the young gentleman, no order would prevent the dowager returning.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is certainly true.&#x201d; He laid his fist on the door frame, gazing out into the gray of the sea and the weather. &#x201c;One des�perately wishes there were word.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If we were needed back in Shejidan,&#x201d; Banichi said, &#x201c;or at Tirnamardi, the aiji would surely call.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> It did not seem the crisis, if crisis there were, lay in the capi�tal. Not so likely. Tatiseigi&#x2019;s sprawling flatlands estate of Tir�namardi was strategically poised between the sprawling flatlands of Ajuri, Cajeiri&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s clan; and the vacant Kadagidi manor, which lay just a short drive up the road from Tirnamardi. Cur�rently Ajuri was held by the detestable great-aunt, but at least had a sort of administration; but the Kadagidi, caught in the same misdeed, were in worse state.

Often erroneously called a forgery, it is in fact six separate books in one, the first two being by Agrippa (1486-1535). One of them, Of Magical Ceremonies, is Agrippa&#39;s clearest step-by-step formulation of how to perform an evocation, much more openly expressed than in his Three Books of Occult Philosophy. In addition there is the key grimoire, Of the Magick of the Ancients by Arbatel, which clearly defines the different types of magic, focusing on the invocation of angels and of the Olympic spirits. The Heptameron by Peter de Abano is a complete, self-contained set of instructions for conjuration of spirits according to the day of the week. Also included is Villinganus&#39; work on the nature of spirits, illusions, prophecies, and miracles, and how they may be used. Two complete geomancies (one by Agrippa) complete the volume, which has been reset in modern type and edited with a commentary by Stephen Skinner.</p><p>Cloth edition of a famous grimoire translated by Robert Turner.

But she was not Benjamin&#x2019;s at that time.&#x201d;</p><p>She noted the lingering bitterness in the man&#x2019;s voice at the mere mention of Benjamin Miller and held it against everything she&#x2019;d learned about the pair since moving to Heavenly, Pennsylvania, thirteen months earlier. The two men had grown up together, their proximity in age and common interest in all things outdoors helping to forge a friendship within the confines of their small Amish community. When they hadn&#x2019;t been helping their elders on their respective farms or sitting side by side in their district&#x2019;s one-room schoolhouse, the boys had often met at the creek to catch frogs, skip stones, and swim. It was a friendship that had soured, though, as they approached their teenage years, thanks to a jealousy Jakob&#x2019;s own father had stoked in his son. Jakob&#x2019;s departure from the Amish fold before his twentieth birthday simply served to sever the tie completely.</p><p>Diane returned to her upholstered lounge chair on the other side of the oval hooked rug and sank into its depths, a worried expression creasing her brow. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to bring up a sore subject, Jakob. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No apologies needed. Elizabeth&#x2019;s heart did not belong to me. I accepted that fact seventeen years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that why you <i>really</i> left the Amish?&#x201d; Claire whispered.</p><p>He shifted his body ever so slightly, grazing his shoulder against hers as he did. &#x201c;No. I left because I wanted to help solve John Zook&#x2019;s murder&#x2014;as a <i>policeman</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a decision that had cost Jakob everything, not the least of which was any hope of a relationship with his childhood family or anyone else from his former Amish life.</p><p>&#x201c;When Elizabeth first told me of her feelings for Benjamin, I was angry. I saw it as yet another way I didn&#x2019;t measure up. But, years later, when I had time and distance to reflect, I knew it was more than that. Elizabeth had changed during Rumspringa. At first, it was a change that brought us closer. But then, like everyone else, she could not accept what I wanted to be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was fascinated by the police long before Zook was murdered. The uniforms that made my family and friends wary, excited me. I wanted to know what they did and where they went. During Rumspringa, while my Amish friends were wearing English clothes and listening to English music, I was spending my time talking to police officers and watching what they did. When Rumspringa was over, my fascination with law enforcement had only grown. Which is why, looking back, I should have <i>known</i> baptism was not right for me. But I resisted. Had I not, I could be a part of my sister&#x2019;s and brother&#x2019;s lives now.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a part of the Amish culture she would never understand. The notion that a man like Jakob could be excommunicated from his family for choosing to serve the public simply didn&#x2019;t sit well. But it was not hers to judge, as Diane always said. Had Jakob made his decision to leave prior to baptism, everything would have been different.</p><p>&#x201c;And Elizabeth?&#x201d; Claire prodded. &#x201c;She was bothered by your fascination?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When her own Rumspringa was over, she was very quiet. I remember her crying a lot. She would never really say why, but she&#x2019;d let me hold her sometimes when she was really upset. Oftentimes I would ask her if she was sure she wanted to be Amish. Each time I asked, she insisted she was.</p><p>&#x201c;I was skeptical until the moment I told her I was thinking about becoming a police officer. She got so upset at the mention of me becoming a cop that I knew, at that moment, that she was confident in her decision to be baptized.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane reclaimed her copy of the <i>Heavenly Times</i> from its spot atop the end table and smoothed it across her lap. &#x201c;Did you happen to know that young Amish girl who left during Rumspringa and never came back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sadie Lehman?&#x201d; Jakob clarified. &#x201c;Sure, I knew her. She was Elizabeth&#x2019;s closest friend. They were like two peas in a pod, as my mother used to say. They played together, dreamed together, went on Rumspringa together. Having Sadie take off like that in the middle of it all was hard on Elizabeth. She thought they were friends, she thought they would be baptized together.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane clucked softly under her breath. &#x201c;Hence the tears that you dried when Elizabeth&#x2019;s Rumspringa was over&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hence the tears I dried,&#x201d; Jakob confirmed. &#x201c;But it was Benjamin, not me, who was finally able to convince Elizabeth that Sadie&#x2019;s decision was God&#x2019;s will.&#x201d;</p><p>There was something about Jakob&#x2019;s tone that made Claire want to reach out and smooth away any and all lingering hurt from his features, but she resisted. There was simply too much uncertainty where his feelings for her were concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;And then, only a few years later, it was <i>Benjamin</i> who had to accept God&#x2019;s will.&#x201d; Diane shook her head slowly, the downward turn in the room&#x2019;s atmosphere beginning to weigh on the sixty-three-year-old&#x2019;s shoulders.</p><p>Jakob stiffened ever so slightly beside Claire. &#x201c;What happened to Elizabeth, exactly? All I&#x2019;ve ever been told is she passed away shortly after she and Ben got married.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Jakob, it was such a sad, sad tragedy,&#x201d; Diane murmured. &#x201c;It was early December, if I remember correctly. She was walking out near those thick woods next to Bishop Hershberger&#x2019;s farm and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait. That&#x2019;s hunting season.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, it was.&#x201d;</p><p>Jakob raked his fingers through his dark blond hair, groaning as he did. &#x201c;Awww no&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire looked from Diane to Jakob and back again. &#x201c;What? What am I missing?&#x201d;</p><p>Pitching forward on the sofa, Jakob dropped his head into his hands. &#x201c;She was killed by a stray bullet, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p><p>Her gasp wasn&#x2019;t loud enough to drown out Diane&#x2019;s affirmation and Jakob&#x2019;s subsequent, louder groan. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had no idea,&#x201d; she stammered. &#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just assumed she&#x2019;d been sick or something.&#x201d; A glance to her right confirmed she wasn&#x2019;t the only one who&#x2019;d made a similar assumption.</p><p>&#x201c;In some ways, I think an illness would have been easier for Benjamin. It would have given him time to prepare. But a simple case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time? There&#x2019;s no way to prepare for something like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Diane&#x2019;s words whispered off only to return on the heels of a weighted sigh. &#x201c;They&#x2019;d been married less than three weeks. <i>Three weeks</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>She searched for something to say&#x2014;for Jakob, for Benjamin, for the woman who&#x2019;d clearly meant so much to both men&#x2014;yet she was speechless.</p><p>&#x201c;I always knew it would take someone mighty special to make that poor man even consider the notion of getting married again. It&#x2019;s just a shame that&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Desperate to keep her aunt from finishing, Claire cleared her throat, then trained her attention on their guest. &#x201c;Hey&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you okay?&#x201d;</p><p>Jakob&#x2019;s hesitation gave way to a reassuring pat on her hand. &#x201c;Yeah. I&#x2019;m okay. I&#x2019;m just stunned. Stunned and saddened for Elizabeth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Ben.&#x201d; Then, squaring his shoulders, he plucked a familiar red-and-white-checked bag from the pocket of his coat and handed it to Claire. &#x201c;I stopped by Shoo Fly Bake Shoppe after work today and thought maybe you&#x2019;d like one of Ruth&#x2019;s famous chocolate chip cookies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The rustle of newspaper on the other side of the rug did little to disguise her aunt&#x2019;s cluck of approval, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. Diane was right. It was a sweet gesture. By a sweet man.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love one, Jakob, thank you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still not sure what I think of this.&#x201d; Diane adjusted her reading glasses atop her nose and then tapped the paper with the back side of her hand. &#x201c;But I know Ryan O&#x2019;Neil must be absolutely beside himself.&#x201d;</p><p>Reluctantly, Claire broke eye contact with Jakob to address her aunt. &#x201c;Who is Ryan O&#x2019;Neil?&#x201d;</p><p>Jakob&#x2019;s non-cookie-holding hand shot into the air. &#x201c;Wait. I know this. He was the mayor of Heavenly during the last few years I lived here as a teenager.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. And he held that office for another three terms before losing to Don Smith about seven or eight years ago. Folks around here thought Ryan would run again the first chance he got, but his pride was wounded and he never did.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire took a bite of Ruth&#x2019;s cookie, savoring the instant burst of chocolate. &#x201c;Mmmm, okay, so what&#x2019;s going on now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His son, Mike, is throwing his hat in the ring for the next mayoral race.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, some of the guys in my department were talking about that this morning. They seem to be divided on how he&#x2019;d be as mayor. The ones who grew up around here seem to find the notion funny; the ones who didn&#x2019;t, think he&#x2019;ll do a decent job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because the ones who grew up around here remember the Michael of old and it&#x2019;s not a very flattering image. Especially in conjunction with someone who wants to hold a position of power in our town.&#x201d; Diane took one last look at the article, then peered up at Claire&#x2019;s sofa mate. &#x201c;Do you remember Mike from back then, Jakob?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Vaguely. I know from my time hovering around the police department during my Rumspringa that he set something on fire once. But nothing happened to him on account of being the mayor&#x2019;s son&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I know he was part of Elizabeth&#x2019;s Rumspringa crew a few years later, thanks to Miriam Hochstetler.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire stopped chewing. &#x201c;How could he have been a part of Elizabeth&#x2019;s Rumspringa? He&#x2019;s English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s exactly why he was part of her crew&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because he <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> Amish,&#x201d; Jakob said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oftentimes, it&#x2019;s through those English counterparts that Amish teens come in contact with things they might not have otherwise,&#x201d; Diane added by way of explanation. &#x201c;Cigarettes, alcohol, mischief, et cetera.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which brings us back to the limited memories I have of the mayor&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The wail of a siren as it raced past the inn brought Jakob&#x2019;s sentence to an end and him to his feet. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the fire department.&#x201d;</p><p>Diane pushed the paper from her lap and stood, her stride and her destination matching that of both Jakob and Claire. When they reached the bay window that overlooked the Amish countryside, they dispensed with the traditional pull string and, instead, parted the curtain with their hands to reveal a bright orange glow in the distance.</p><p>Claire felt the gasp as it escaped her throat, knew it had been echoed by her aunt, but all she could truly focus on was the sound of Jakob&#x2019;s voice as he barked into the phone now clutched to his ear.</p><p>&#x201c;Detective Fisher. What&#x2019;s going on? Copy that address, please&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Okay, got it. I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;</p><p>He snapped the phone closed inside his hand, returned it to his pocket, and then gathered Claire&#x2019;s hands inside his own. &#x201c;Stoltzfus&#x2019;s barn is on fire and they&#x2019;re worried about the house going next. I&#x2019;ve got to get out there and help. But I want to thank you&#x201d;&#x2014;his gaze left hers just long enough to offer a quick yet deliberate nod in Diane&#x2019;s direction&#x2014;&#x201c;for tonight. For the conversation, the warmth, and the sense of normalcy. I can&#x2019;t think of the last time I felt so at home anywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>And then he was gone, his strong, confident footfalls disappearing as he made his way through the front door and into the night, the rising pillar of flames in the distance guiding his path.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Claire stood at the lone window overlooking the alleyway between her store and Shoo Fly Bake Shoppe and watched as Ruth Miller carried one box after the other through her side entrance.</p><p>The boxes, in varying shapes and sizes, were a normal part of the workday for each and every shopkeeper along the cobblestoned thoroughfare that connected the English and Amish sides of Heavenly. But unlike the other shopkeepers, the Amish bakery owner didn&#x2019;t carry her own boxes. Ever.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t that she wasn&#x2019;t capable&#x2014;because she was. And it wasn&#x2019;t that the twenty-two-year-old beauty was some sort of kapp-wearing diva&#x2014;because nothing could be further from the truth. But she <i>was</i> Eli Miller&#x2019;s twin sister. That, coupled with being Benjamin Miller&#x2019;s unmarried little sister, was all the explanation needed.</p><p>Every morning, while the gas-powered lampposts still burned bright up and down Lighted Way, Benjamin delivered the bakery&#x2019;s supply of fresh milk in his horse-drawn wagon. Once the shop opened, Eli showed up at various points throughout the day to attend to any deliveries and carry out the trash that had accumulated between visits. They came quietly, performed their tasks quietly, and left quietly, the only indication they were around coming via the whinny of their respective horses in the now-empty alley.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>It had to be.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders amid the lull in customers, Claire wound her way around the counter and into the back room, the hinges of the screen door announcing her presence in the alley as surely as any verbal greeting ever could.</p><p>Ruth looked up from the dwindling stack of boxes at her feet and smiled shyly. &#x201c;Good ...</p></p><h2>The Day of Atonement: A Novel (Benjamin Weaver)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Enthralling . . .

That much, I believe, I have established in the previous account of enraged rival-�pummeling. If I am a monster, however, then I am monster made, not born.<br><br>Indeed, I was made by men such as the priest who stood before me.<br><br>A man might live in London all his life, might upon a daily basis risk encounters with cutpurses and toughs, renegados who would slit a stranger&#x2019;s throat for no reason but the thrill of murder, and for all that never cross paths with anyone as dangerous as a Portuguese priest. Here was the real devil.<br><br>Standing in the gloom on the Falmouth packet ship, I watched his movements, the half-�laugh and calculated smile as he peered through my cabin door. The priest&#x2019;s expression revealed nothing, for deception was the way of his kind, as natural to him as lying down at day&#x2019;s end is to you. But it could be my way too. I had not come to Lisbon to kill this particular priest, but I would kill him all the same if the need arose and not regret it. I&#x2019;d never killed anyone in my life, but I knew I could. Refraining from murder, not the murder itself, had always been the difficult part.<br><br>The priest was not five feet in height, and so plump that he looked like a ball for a child&#x2019;s fairground game. His eyes were wide and bloodshot; his nose large and red from, I supposed, a healthy appreciation of Portuguese wine; and his ears comically massive and hairy. It was impossible to conceive of a countenance less threatening than that of this stunted man with his fleshy fingers, thick as carrot stubs, wiggling as though he played upon an invisible pianoforte. The priest&#x2019;s masters had chosen him for his task precisely because he seemed harmless and bumbling, the very thing to soften the Englishman&#x2019;s fear of papists, a mistrust bred into his roast-�beef heart since the days of Bloody Mary.<br><br>The ship upon which I had arrived had been at anchor only a few hours now, and it was necessary to undergo this little dance with the priest before I could set foot on dry land. I made no complaint. I was not yet ready to leave, though I had watched from the deck as we approached the City of Seven Hills, as Lisbon styled itself. (The claim, of course, was rubbish. There were far more than seven hills, but the great men of the capital liked to shave off a few insignificant mounds of earth, all the better to suggest a similarity to imperial Rome. Rather like suggesting a monkey resembles a lion because they both have tails, but of the city&#x2019;s many crimes, an inclination to boast was among the more forgivable.)<br><br>First the packet had anchored by the stout watchtower at Bel�m so the health inspector might take a cursory tour through the small ship, looking into our eyes and mouths, making certain we were not spotted or vomiting or covered with boils. There we had been treated to a bit of theater. Act I: the health inspector finds much in the crew&#x2019;s appearance to alarm him&#x2014;�sallow complexions, coughing here and there, some alarming smells from the chamber pots. These sailors, he concludes, must never be allowed to spread their contagion ashore. Act II: The captain presses into the inspector&#x2019;s hands a purse bursting with silver. Act III: The inspector, upon closer examination, decides that the crew is healthy indeed, and the packet is given permission to continue. The curtain falls, and all applaud.<br><br>As we continued on our way, I had watched as the distant palaces and monasteries and cathedrals glittered into view. Then, as we had moved east into the Tagus, came my first glimpse of the white stone and blue tiles and red terracotta roofs. There were the clusters of poor hovels in the Baixa and the Alfama. There were the flashes of green from the juniper and Mediterranean oaks and olive and lemon trees. There was the distant sound of a thousand churches ringing their bells at once.<br><br>The August sun had warmed my face as the ship sliced through the sapphire water toward this city, so strange and so familiar. In my memory, Lisbon was a place of looming dusk, its sky forever domed by sooty clouds. It was a land cast in gloom eternal, where shadows had more substance than men. Now the sunlight and the swirl of color, the indifferent beauty of the city and the sea, struck me as a species of mockery, one more deception from Lisbon&#x2019;s endless supply. That was well enough. This time, I had a few deceptions of my own.<br><br>Even for the wary, a category that describes nearly every English�man who arrives in Portugal, the city exuded its charms. Lisbon had seduced its share of pinch-�faced and scornful Anglicans, come to spend a year or two, but who remained for as many decades. Poverty and despair and injustice were hidden from this distance. They were not on the skin of the beast, but in its lifeblood, flowing through secret channels and arteries, so that from the Tagus the eye fell only upon beauty paid for with Brazilian gold and diamonds. Domes and towers and arches jutted forth to announce that here was greatness, here was power. This was the story the Portuguese liked to tell themselves. If they spoke the words often enough, perhaps they could shout down the truth.<br><br>These last brooding thoughts I had indulged in from my cabin. I had already seen enough of Lisbon at a distance that morning, and I was not yet ready to return to the place I had lived for the first thirteen years of my life. Lisbon had been my home and my cruel master. Lisbon had taken my parents and stolen from me my friends. Now, I would soon walk its streets. I wished I had not hidden away Gabriela&#x2019;s scarf, saved all these years, for I wanted to hold it. That ragged bit of cloth had become the sole monument to all I had lost, and I thought it would, at the very least, fire my determination.<br><br>The priest was but the first test, the first coin to deposit at a long and ever greedier series of tollhouses. He had appeared outside my open cabin door in his black coat and white cravat, grinning cheerfully and knocking with a lively flick of the wrist as though he were an old friend come to call. I turned to face him, and it was at that moment that I truly understood, perhaps for the first time, that I had placed myself in an impossibly dangerous situation. This thought cheered me.<br><br>&#x201c;Now then, you must be Sebastian Foxx,&#x201d; the priest said in native English. His voice contained only warmth. Like his appearance, it was meant to announce that this was a harmless man, jolly and good-�hearted, no one to fear. This was no agent of a corrupt and degenerate institution, its maw set on devouring good Protestants and shitting out papist turds. No, no, he was just a jolly fat man, and who doesn&#x2019;t love one of those?<br><br>&#x201c;I am Foxx.&#x201d; I stooped slightly as I spoke, for I am tall, and the cabin&#x2019;s ceiling was low enough to brush my wig. A typical Englishman, on his way to Lisbon to engage in trade, might think of the cabin as a prison cell, and the beckoning city outside as freedom. I knew the precise opposite to be true.<br><br>The priest stepped into the gloomy chamber and reached out to take my hand, which he clasped with familiar warmth. His skin was sweaty and not at all pleasant to the touch. I wished I had put on my gloves. I would make a point never again to touch a priest without them.<br><br>&#x201c;I am delighted to meet all newly arrived Englishmen,&#x201d; he assured me, &#x201c;but as you are the only one on this packet, today I am especially delighted to meet you. You have rescued me from a very dull afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>I had seen priests in London&#x2014;�many of them and regularly&#x2014;�though these were generally of the Church of England. From time to time I had also spied clerics of the Romish church, but upon English soil such men were utterly impotent, deprived of rights and privileges, and more despised than Jews. They were frightened, skittish things, prone at any time to be struck with dead rats hurled by gleeful children raised not to understand entirely the difference between a Catholic priest and Satan. Here, in Portugal, it was another matter. This affable man could have anyone he pleased arrested upon suspicion of any crime, or, if he chose, no crime at all. A stranger upon the street whom the priest cared mark with a jab of his thick finger would find himself clapped in chains and dragged to the dungeons of the Palace of the Inquisition. The Inquisitions of France and Italy, even the notorious Inquisition of Spain&#x2014;�they were all dead or toothless. In Portugal, the Inquisition continued unabated, deadly and pervasive and merciless.<br><br>I laughed nervously, for I did not wish to appear at my ease. My long apprenticeship under the great thief taker, Benjamin Weaver, had given me many skills. Most of them could be best witnessed as I thrashed a defenseless man in a London alley, but there were skills of a subtler nature too. For example, I knew how to pretend to be someone I was not, and this was more than simply making claims about oneself. A man&#x2019;s nature was conveyed by a thousand means, by movements of hands and eyes and mouth, by how he stood or sat, by what he looked at and looked like. I little doubted my ability to make the priest believe I was what I wished him to see.<br><br>I returned the priest&#x2019;s handshake, though my hand threatened to slip from his well-�greased grip. &#x201c;I very much doubt I shall relieve you from dullness, for I&#x2019;ve little to say that will prove entertaining.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you are wrong, my son,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;I love nothing above meeting new gentlemen.&#x201d; Then he released my hand, and I was glad of it.<br><br>I invited the priest to sit in one of the rough wooden chairs bolted to the floor. The vessel had not been built for the comfort of its passengers. The packet&#x2019;s chief purpose was to convey goods and mail from Lisbon to Falmouth and back again on behalf of the English Factory. Sometimes the packet carried many voyagers, sometimes but one or two, and none of these enjoyed any particular luxury. My cabin contained only two chairs, a table, a bed, and a trunk for storing a few articles of clothing. When upon the seas, it was near impossible to move without knocking into the furnishings, and my shins bore bruises from unsteady efforts to dress or use the privy.<br><br>&#x201c;Now then. Sebastian Foxx,&#x201d; the priest said, consulting a little book full of notes written in a dense hand, each stroke neat and fully articulated. &#x201c;This is your first voyage to Lisbon, I see.&#x201d;<br><br>I said nothing for several long seconds as I scratched at crystallized salt upon the splintering arm of my chair. It was something an anxious man might do. Indeed, it was something I ought to do in earnest, for what I planned to do was madness. I ought to be terribly anxious.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me,&#x201d; I said, affecting mild embarrassment. &#x201c;I was surprised to hear you are an Englishman, or you speak as one at the very least.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Henry Winston, originally of Marylebone,&#x201d; the little man said with an easy smile and a new round of spasmodic finger wiggling. &#x201c;And now I am here, in Lisbon. It is the place for an Englishman of my religion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is what I have heard. Indeed, I ought not to be surprised to meet you, but it is one thing to be told there are English priests in Lisbon and quite another to encounter one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Most Englishmen regard my religion as a form of plague,&#x201d; said Winston. &#x201c;They do not wish to get too close for fear I shall infect them with my Romishness.&#x201d; His laugh sounded decidedly practiced.<br><br>&#x201c;It seems foolish to recoil from Catholics in Lisbon,&#x201d; I noted, like a man trying to ingratiate himself. &#x201c;They are everywhere. Or so I am made to understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is a devout city, and with no small share of priests, true enough. And we must do our duty.&#x201d; The ship pitched a bit upon a wave, and Winston lashed out to take hold of his chair. He looked positively abashed an instant later. &#x201c;You must think little of me, but even anchored upon the river, I do not much care for the feel of a ship upon the water.&#x201d;<br><br>It was admittedly a bit choppy, but I had grown used to movement of the seas. The weather had been much rougher on the passage from Falmouth. Once we had come upon a summer storm and there had been general fear of foundering. Ill content to cower in my cabin and hope we remained afloat, I had joined with the sailors in securing the deck. While my attention had been fixed upon loose riggings that whipped around with strength enough to snap a man&#x2019;s bones, a great wave had collided with the ship, sweeping torrents of blood-�warm water across the deck. I had grabbed a rope an instant before the water slammed into me, blasting my body twenty feet into the air. The wind screamed in my ears. Lightning flashed, illuminating the frantic efforts of the seamen below. For a moment I was aloft, flapping like a standard. It seemed I might be up there forever or might as easily let go, losing myself in the tempest, merging with it, not in truth dying, but simply changing form to wind and rain and lightning. My hands were raw, and bursts of light illuminated the bloodstained rope. I could not hold on much longer, so perhaps I should choose the moment rather than leaving it to uncaring chance. Was there not some merit in making the decision myself? Was there not honor in surrendering to the elements?<br><br>Then, for no more than a heartbeat, the wind paused, and I fell, colliding against the wet wood of the deck. I was briefly insensible, but I soon awoke with a dull ache down one side of my body and the taste of blood in my mouth, my hands stinging. The pain was nothing but distant noise compared to the spiteful satisfaction of knowing the wave and the wind were gone, and I yet remained.<br><br>To the priest I said, &#x201c;In time, a man grows used to the waves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not a sailing man. I made the voyage here once, and shall never return.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded slowly, showing the priest the unease and caution he would expect, and then a bit more beside. About now he would begin to suspect that I had something to hide. I would appear to do my best to make conversation, but not chat easily. I would affect comfort, but my actions would betray a man unskilled at keeping secrets. If he was a perceptive fellow, and they would have no other kind in this role, he would see it all.<br><br>He clapped his hands together. &#x201c;To business then. Portugal is a Roman Catholic kingdom, as you are aware. The open practice of other religions is not tolerated. You may not bring Protestant prayer books or Bibles into the country. You may not discuss your religion with anyone not already a declared Protestant, and then only within a private residence, and never upon the streets or within a public building. You must show respect for all members of the Church, all processionals and displays of faith, even when they are not led by a representative of the Church. Failure to do so will be to invite the attention of the Inquisition, which you wish to avoid. The Inquisition has the power to arrest anyone on Portuguese soil for any reason it may choose. Being English or wealthy offers no immunity if you are guilty of heresy.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew all of this very well, but did not, of course, indicate the depth of my understanding. Instead I told him that the captain had explained these details previously.<br><br>The priest then smiled, perhaps to soften his message. &#x201c;It is by no means a difficult thing for an Englishman to spend his time here unmolested by the Inquisition, but respect for our ways and a willingness to be forthcoming are necessary. So, to begin, you must tell me why you have come to Lisbon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am to engage in business,&#x201d; I answered, letting the prepared lie roll off my tongue, savoring this first course. &#x201c;I have come into an inheritance and now wish to establish myself as a factor, perhaps to work m...</p><h2>Nomad: From Islam to America: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations</h2><p>"This woman is a major hero of our time." &#x2014;Richard Dawkins <br><br>Ayaan Hirsi Ali captured the world&#x2019;s attention with <i>Infidel, </i>her compelling coming-of-age memoir, which spent thirty-one weeks on the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller list. Now, in <i>Nomad, </i>Hirsi Ali tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made to her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed, and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical journey to freedom and, more crucially, her emotional journey to freedom&#x2014;her transition from a tribal mind-set that restricts women&#x2019;s every thought and action to a life as a free and equal citizen in an open society. Through stories of the challenges she has faced, she shows the difficulty of reconciling the contradictions of Islam with Western values. <br><br>In these pages Hirsi Ali recounts the many turns her life took after she broke with her family, and how she struggled to throw off restrictive superstitions and misconceptions that initially hobbled her ability to assimilate into Western society. She writes movingly of her reconciliation, on his deathbed, with her devout father, who had disowned her when she renounced Islam after 9/11, as well as with her mother and cousins in Somalia and in Europe. <br><br><i>Nomad </i>is a portrait of a family torn apart by the clash of civilizations. But it is also a touching, uplifting, and often funny account of one woman&#x2019;s discovery of today&#x2019;s America. While Hirsi Ali loves much of what she encounters, she fears we are repeating the European mistake of underestimating radical Islam. She calls on key institutions of the West&#x2014;including universities, the feminist movement, and the Christian churches&#x2014;to enact specific, innovative remedies that would help other Muslim immigrants to overcome the challenges she has experienced and to resist the fatal allure of fundamentalism and terrorism. <br><br>This is Hirsi Ali&#x2019;s intellectual coming-of-age, a memoir that conveys her philosophy as well as her experiences, and that also conveys an urgent message and mission&#x2014;to inform the West of the extent of the threat from Islam, both from outside and from within our open societies. A celebration of free speech and democracy, <i>Nomad </i>is an important contribution to the history of ideas, but above all a rousing call to action.</p><p><b>Ayaan Hirsi Ali</b> was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, was raised Muslim, and spent her childhood and young adulthood in Africa and Saudi Arabia. In 1992, Hirsi Ali came to the Netherlands as a refugee. She earned her college degree in political science and worked for the Dutch Labor party. She denounced Islam after the September 11 terrorist attacks and now serves as a Dutch parliamentarian, fighting for the rights of Muslim women in Europe, the enlightenment of Islam, and security in the West.<b>Chapter 1<br>My Father</b><br><br>When I walked into the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal London Hospital to see my father, I feared I might have come too late. He was sprawled across the hospital bed, his mouth eerily agape, and the machines that were attached to him were many and menacing. They beeped and ticked, and the lines that rapidly rose and fell on their monitors all seemed to be indicating a rapid countdown to his death.<br><br>"<i>Abeh</i>," I yelled at the top of my voice. "<i>Abeh</i>, it's me, Ayaan."<br><br>I squeezed his hand and anxiously kissed his forehead, and my father's eyes flew open. He smiled, and the warmth of his gaze and his smile radiated through the whole room. I put my palms over his right hand and he squeezed them and tried to speak, to force out at least a word or two. But he could only wheeze and gasp for breath. He strained to sit up, but he couldn't lift his body.<br><br>He was covered with white sheets, and it looked as if he were tied to the bed. Bald, he looked much smaller than I remembered. There was a terrible tube in his throat that was giving him oxygen through a ventilator; another led from his kidney to a dialysis machine, and yet another mess of tubes went into his wrist. I sat beside him and stroked his face and told him, "Abeh, Abeh, it's all right. Abeh, my poor Abeh, you're so sick."<br><br>He couldn't answer. Trying to speak, he would fall back, his chest pumping, and the machine that gave him oxygen would hiss and gasp for more air. Then, after resting for a moment or two, he would try again. He indicated with his right hand that he wanted a pen to write with, but he could hardly hold it; his muscles were too weak and he made only scratches on the paper. He was struggling so hard to hold the pen that he began sliding off the bed.<br><br>The ward was large, and nurses were bustling about changing sheets and giving medication. I noticed that the doctor had an accent and for a moment thought that he was from Mexico. When I asked where he came from he told me that he was from Spain. The ward was run almost entirely by immigrants. I could not tell the nurses from the doctors, and as I looked around I tried to guess the origins of the members of the medical team, technicians, and cleaners: the Indian Peninsula, blacks who I thought were from East or West Africa, people who looked North African, a few women with headscarves over their medical uniforms. If there were any Somali employees in the ward I did not see them, and fortunately they did not see me.<br><br>One of the nurses unrolled a plastic smock, tied it around her waist, and asked me to step aside, but my father would not let go of me and I had to pry his fingers from around my hand. The nurse propped him up higher with pillows, staring at me oddly. One of the nurses told me that she had read an article about me in a magazine, so some of them knew who I was. I glanced away and noticed the chart on his bed; it listed my father as Hirsi Magan Abdirahman, although his name is Hirsi Magan Isse.<br><br>A young doctor told me that my father had leukemia. He could have lived another year had he not caught an infection, which had become septic. Now, although he was out of the coma that he had fallen into a few days earlier, only the machines were keeping him alive. I asked again and again if my father was in pain, but the doctor said no, he was uncomfortable, but there was no pain.<br><br>I asked the doctor if I could take a picture with my father. He refused. He said we needed to ask the permission of the patient, and the patient was not in any state to make that decision.<br>In 1992, when I left him in Nairobi, my father was a strong, vital man. He could be fierce, even frightening - a lion, a leader of men. When I was growing up he was my lord, my hero, someone whose absence was mysterious, whose presence I longed for, whose approval meant everything and whose wrath I feared.<br><br>Now so many disputes lay between us. I had offended him deeply in 1992 by running away from a Somali man he had chosen for me to marry. He had forgiven me for that; we had spoken together, stiffly, on the phone. A decade later I offended him again, when I declared myself an unbeliever and openly criticized Islam's treatment of women. Our last, and worst, conflict was after I made a film about the abuse and oppression of Muslim women, <i>Submission</i>, with Theo van Gogh in 2004. After that my father simply would not answer the phone; he would not talk to me. Sometime after Theo was killed, when I had to go into hiding and my phone was taken away from me, I stopped trying to call him. When people asked, I could say only that we were estranged.<br><br>I learned he was sick in June 2008, only a few weeks before his death. I had received a message from Marco, my ex-boyfriend in Holland, saying that my cousin Magool in England was looking for me urgently. Magool is not close to my father's family, but she is resourceful. When my half sister, Sahra, realized how sick my father was, she asked Magool to try to track me down, and Magool called Marco, the only person she knew to whom I had been close when she and I had last spoken, five years earlier.<br><br>I phoned my father at his apartment in a housing development in the East End of London. It was late in the evening where he was, a bright sunny afternoon on the East Coast of America where I was. I was shaking. When he came to the phone he sounded just like himself, strong and excited. At the sound of his voice I felt tears welling in my eyes and I said the only thing I wanted to convey, that I loved him, and I heard his smile, so powerful it seemed to come through the telephone.<br><br>"Of course you love me!" he burst out loudly. "And of course I love you! Haven't you seen how parents cuddle and connect with their children? Haven't you been out in nature where you see how animals pet and lick their young? Of course I love you. You are my child."<br><br>I told my father how much I wanted to see him, but I explained that it might be difficult to arrange security for a visit to his apartment, which is a mostly immigrant area and overwhelmingly Muslim. To visit such a place without protection would be like a very small insect risking a flight through a roomful of huge spiders' webs; the little bug might get through unnoticed, but if it gets caught the consequences are clear. On the other hand, if I went there <i>with</i> police, that would be bound to cause ill feeling, as if I could not trust my own family.<br><br>"Security!" my father cried. "What do you need security for? Allah will protect you against anyone who wants to harm you! No one in our community will lay a finger on you. And besides, our family has never had a reputation for being cowardly! In fact the other day one of our most prominent clan members said that he wanted to debate with you. If you want, I can ask them to put together a delegation and take you to Jeddah, so you can debate him in Saudi Arabia! Why don't you arrange a press conference and say that you are no longer an unbeliever? Tell them that you have returned to Islam and from now on you're a businesswoman!"<br><br>I laughed quietly at my father, and for a while I just enjoyed listening to him talk. Then I asked after his health. He said, "You must remember, Ayaan, that our health and our lives are in the hands of Allah. I am on my way to the hereafter. My dear child, what I want you to do is read just one chapter of the Quran. <i>Laa-uqsim Bi-yawmiil-qiyaama</i>."<br><br>He recited - in Arabic, of course, though we were speaking Somali - a chapter called "The Resurrection": "I do call to witness the resurrection day; and I do call to witness the self-reproaching spirit; Does man think that we cannot assemble his bones? Nay, we are able to put together in perfect order the very tips of his fingers. But man wishes to do wrong in the time in front of him; he questions, when is the day of resurrection?"<br><br>I told my father that I would not lie to him, and that I no longer believed in the example of the Prophet. He cut me off, and his tone became passionate, impatient, then retributive. He read me more verses of the Quran, translating them into Somali, and he listed many examples of people like me, who had left Islam but had come back to the faith. He talked about hordes of non-Muslims converting to Islam across the globe, and he told me about the one true god; he warned me not to risk my hereafter.<br><br>As I listened to him I told myself that this magisterial lecture was from a father expressing his love in the only way he knew. I wanted to believe that the very fact that he was lecturing me meant that, in some deeper sense, he had begun to forgive me for the person I had become. Possibly, however, it was not that. Possibly he was only doing his duty. Living as a Western woman meant I had shed my honor; I wore Western clothes, which to him was no better than if I walked around wearing no clothes at all. Worst of all, I had abjured Islam and written a book with the brazen, triumphant title <i>Infidel</i> to proclaim my apostasy. But my father knew that his life was coming to an end, and he wanted to make sure that all his children, despite their errors, were safe on a path to heaven.<br><br>I let him talk. I didn't make false promises to convert. If I had, that might have helped him leave in peace, but I couldn't do it, I couldn't lie to him about that. I managed to tell him gently that although I no longer agreed with Islam, I would read the Quran. I did not add that, every time I reread it, I became more critical of its messages.<br><br>He broke into a series of supplications: "May Allah protect you, may He bring you back to the straight path, may He take you to Heaven in the hereafter, may Allah bless you and keep you healthy." And at the end of every supplication I responded with the required formula: "<i>Amin</i>," May it be so.<br><br>After a little while I told my father I had a flight to catch. He didn't ask where to, or why; I could tell that the details of terrestrial matters had little bearing for him now. Then I hung up, with so many more things left unsaid between us, and I almost missed the plane that was taking me to a conference in Brazil on multiculturalism.<br>At the end of June, after the conference in Brazil, I was scheduled to go to Australia for a colloquium on the Enlightenment. I planned to visit my father in London at the end of the summer. But in mid-August, on my way back from Australia, during a stopover in Los Angeles, I received another phone call from Marco. My father was in a coma.<br><br>I called my cousin Magool again, and she gave me the cell phone number of my half sister, Sahra. The last time I'd seen my father's youngest child, in 1992, Sahra was eight or nine years old, a wiry, energetic little kid. I had met her when stopping off in Ethiopia en route from my home in Kenya to Germany. From there, on my father's orders, I was supposed to go on to Canada, to join a man I barely knew, who was a distant cousin and who had become my husband. In those days Sahra lived in Addis Ababa with her mother, who, like my own mother, was still married to my father in spite of his absence. I had played with this little half sister of mine all afternoon, struggling to remember my childhood Amharic, which was the only language Sahra spoke back then and which I too had spoken when I was her age and still lived with my father.<br><br>Now, in the summer of 2008, Sahra was twenty-four. She was married and had her own four-month-old daughter. She lived with her mother, my father's third wife.<br><br>I didn't tell Sahra that I planned to visit our father in the hospital. It's a hideous thing to write, but I didn't really know if I could trust her with that information. I assume the closest members of my family don't actually want to kill me, but the truth is that I have shamed and hurt them; they have to deal with the outrage that my public statements cause, and undoubtedly some members of my clan do want to kill me for that.<br><br>Sahra volunteered the suggestion that if I did go to see Abeh, I should avoid visiting hours, when floods of Somalis would be going to the Royal London Hospital to seek a blessing from my father in order to improve their own chances of getting into heaven. For many, Abeh was a symbol of the battle against President Siad Barre's military regime, a man who had dedicated most of his adult life to overthrowing that regime. It would be the same in the East End of London as it was in Somalia: the many wives, the many children and grandchildren, the elders of the clan and the subclan and the brother subclans, scores and scores of relatives would come to my father to pay their respects. For many of those people I would not be welcome at my father's bedside because I was an unbeliever, an infidel, an avowed atheist, a filthy runaway, and worst of all, a traitor to the clan and to the faith. Some of them would certainly feel that I deserve to die, and to many more my presence would defile my father's deathbed and perhaps even cost him his place in the hereafter.<br><br>I felt no such rejection from Sahra, however. She was sweet and hushed, a little conspiratorial, as if by talking with her on the phone I had enrolled her in something clandestine and dangerous.<br><br>* * *<br><br>I needed to fly to London right away. Because this was an urgent, unplanned, purely personal trip, arranging security was going to be complicated, unlike attending a conference, for which everything is officially coordinated with the police weeks ahead of time. I knew it wouldn't be wise just to go, accompanied by the gentlemen who usually protect me in America. In Britain these men would not know their way around and would not be allowed to carry weapons. If I were rash in my planning I might put others as well as myself in danger.<br><br>I phoned a number of friends in Europe who I thought might be influential and asked them to try to help me arrange the protection I needed to make the trip. They spent many hours trying to help me, seemingly without success. One friend was told by a British official that as I was born in Somalia I should ask the Somali Embassy for help; they could approach the Foreign Office to seek security assistance for me. This absurd bureaucratic logic might have been comical in some circumstances, but not in the face of my need to get to London to see my dying father.<br><br>When my plane took off for London I still had no idea whether I would have any security protection when it landed. But that no longer mattered; after days of waiting I feared only that I might be too late. I knew that, if my father were to die, I would not be allowed to see his body. He would be whisked away by male relatives to be washed and prepared and buried within twenty-four hours. Women are not allowed to be present at the graveside during a Muslim burial ceremony. It is believed that their presence is disruptive; they might become hysterical, perhaps even hurl themselves into the grave to be with the corpse. It would be unseemly to try to attend.<br><br>My father had a contradictory attitude to women. He embraced some modern ideas on literacy, urged his first wife to attend university, and insisted that my sister Haweya and I go to school when my mother resisted the idea. He believed in women's strength and he repeatedly insisted that a woman's role was valuable and important. But as he aged he became more orthodox in his Islamic convictions that we must cover ourselves, marry, and submit to our husbands. Despite his often eccentric views, even my father would not have tolerated seeing a woman at a funeral.<br>When I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London a large black car from the Dutch Embassy was there to greet me; another, smaller but even safer, held men from Scotland Yard. We drove straight to the hospital. Now, to...</p><h2>Magic Mushrooms in Religion and Alchemy</h2><p>An illustrated foray into the hidden truth about the use of psychoactive mushrooms to connect with the divine. <br><br>� Draws parallels between Vedic beliefs and Judeo-Christian sects, showing the existence of a mushroom cult that crossed cultural boundaries. <br><br>� Contends that the famed philosophers' stone of the alchemist was a metaphor for the mushroom. <br><br>� Confirms and extends Robert Gordon Wasson's hypothesis of the role of the fly agaric mushroom in generating religious visions. <br><br>Rejecting arguments that the elusive philosophers' stone of alchemy and the Hindu elixir of life were mere legend, Clark Heinrich provides a strong case that <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, the fly agaric mushroom, played this role in world religious history. Working under the assumption that this "magic mushroom" was the mysterious food and drink of the gods, Heinrich traces its use in Vedic and Puranic religion, illustrating how ancient cultures used the powerful psychedelic in esoteric rituals meant to bring them into direct contact with the divine. He then shows how the same mushroom symbols found in Hindu scriptures correspond perfectly to the symbols of ancient Judaism, Christianity, the Grail myths, and alchemy, arguing that miraculous stories as disparate as the burning bush of Moses and the raising of Lazarus from the dead can be easily explained by the use of this strange and powerful mushroom. While acknowledging the speculative nature of his work, Heinrich concludes that in many religious cultures and traditions the fly agaric mushroom--and in some cases ergot or psilocybin mushrooms--had a fundamental influence in teaching humans about the nature of God. His insightful book truly brings new light to the religious history of humanity.</p><p>Clark Heinrich has been an ethnobotanist since 1974 and has completed years of study with masters of yoga philosophy and Western mysticism. The coauthor of <i>The Apples of Apollo</i>, Heinrich lives in the coastal mountains of central California.Page vi-vii: <br>Considering what we know about drug use and group sexual activities in certain early religious cults, there may have been quite a bit to hide. I believe that a number of the writings that have come down to us from ancient religious movements do contain secret double entendres, the alternative meanings of which, quite intentionally, are not apparent in a casual reading of the text. Many of these writings contain curious sayings and references that have never been adequately explained or understood; they are seemingly designed to remain forever hidden unless the ruse could be revealed and the passwords made known. <br>Page viii: <br>Quantum physics speaks of possible parallel universes existing alongside the one we know; this book can be thought of as a parallel history. These things may have happened as I am presenting them or they may not have, but one thing is certain: namely, that I have discovered a definite pattern of related symbols in story after story, even stories from different traditions and different parts of the world. As disparate as these stories are they all have in common distinct correspondences to one and the same thing: the beautiful and intoxicating Amanita muscaria mushroom, commonly known in English as the fly agaric.</p><h2>Bubble in the Bathtub (Doctor Proctor&#39;s Fart Powder)</h2><p><b>Doctor Proctor and the kids (and the fart powder!) are back with a time traveling bathtub and a very special mission!

Nothing was making a sound&#x2014;not the twelve sets of brown wooden climbing bars along the walls, not the old pommel horse covered in cracked leather, or the eight gray well-worn ropes hanging motionless from the ceiling, or the sixteen boys and girls who made up the D�lgen School Marching Band and who were now all staring at Conductor Madsen.</p><p>&#x201c;Ready ...,&#x201d; Mr. Madsen called out. He raised his baton, and squinted at them through his dark aviator sunglasses. Mr. Madsen, with dread in his eyes, searched hopefully for Nilly. He knew the other kids in the band teased the redheaded trumpet player because he was so tiny, which of course he was. But unlike the other band members, the little guy had some musical ability. Maybe he could turn things around today. Since Mr. Madsen didn&#x2019;t see Nilly, he looked over at the only friend Nilly had&#x2014;Lisa, who played the clarinet. She was the only one in the band who always practiced at home. Maybe there was hope after all.</p><p>&#x201c;Set ...&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone put their instruments to their lips. It was so quiet that the sounds of the warm October afternoon outside could be heard: birds singing, a lawn mower humming, and the laughter of little, snotty-nosed kids playing. But inside the gym it was dark. And it was going to get even darker.</p><p>&#x201c;Go!&#x201d; Mr. Madsen yelled, swinging his baton in a majestic arc.</p><p>At first nothing happened, and the only things you could hear were still birds singing, lawn mowing, and snotty-nosed kids laughing. Then a trumpet gave a wobbly bleat, a clarinet squeaked timidly, and there was a tentative thump on a bass drum. An unexpected beat on a snare drum made a French horn splutter out a belching sound, and in the back of the band something big emitted a snort, one that made Lisa think of a blue whale that had just surfaced after a week underwater. But all that blowing still hadn&#x2019;t produced an actual note, and Mr. Madsen&#x2019;s face was already starting to turn that color red that warned he was about to lose his temper.</p><p>&#x201c;Two-three!&#x201d; Mr. Madsen screamed, swinging his baton as if it were a whip and the band members were the slave crew manning the oars of a Roman galley. &#x201c;Well, play for Heaven&#x2019;s sake! This is supposed to be the Marseillaise, the French national anthem! Give it some dignity!&#x201d;</p><p>But there was no dignity in this. The faces in front of Mr. Madsen stared stiffly at the music on the stands in front of them or their eyes were squeezed shut, as if they were sitting on the toilet, straining.</p><p>Mr. Madsen gave up and dropped his arms just as the tuba finally emitted a sound&#x2014;a deep, forlorn mooing sound.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop, stop!&#x201d; Mr. Madsen yelled, and then waited until the tuba ran out of air again. &#x201c;If anyone from France had just heard you guys, they would have beheaded you first and then burned you at the stake. Let&#x2019;s show some respect for the Marseillaise!&#x201d;</p><p>As Mr. Madsen continued to chew them out, Lisa leaned over to the seat next to her and whispered, &#x201c;I brought that postcard from Doctor Proctor. There&#x2019;s something weird about it.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice that answered her came from behind a beat-up trumpet. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s like the last one, sounds like a normal postcard if you ask me. &#x2018;Dear Lisa and Nilly, Greetings from Paris. Sincerely, Doctor Proctor.&#x2019; Isn&#x2019;t that pretty much what you said he wrote?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yeah, but ...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The only thing that&#x2019;s <i>not</i> normal about it is that a person who is as weird and eccentric as Doctor Proctor would write such a normal postcard.&#x201d;</p><p>They were interrupted by Mr. Madsen&#x2019;s thunderous voice: &#x201c;Nilly? Is that you? Are you down there?&#x201d;</p><p>A voice replied from behind the battered trumpet, &#x201c;Aye aye, Sergeant!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get up so we can see you, Nilly!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, oh great commander of delightful music and all the notes of the universe!&#x201d;</p><p>And a little redheaded boy with big freckles and a broad grin jumped up from behind the music stand, onto the chair. Actually, he wasn&#x2019;t just small, he was tiny. And his hair wasn&#x2019;t just red, it was bright red. And his grin wasn&#x2019;t just broad, it practically split his little head in two. And his freckles weren&#x2019;t just big, they were ... well, all right, they were just big.</p><p>&#x201c;Play the Marseillaise for us, Nilly!&#x201d; Mr. Madsen growled. &#x201c;The way it&#x2019;s supposed to be played.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By your command, great mother of all conductors and king of all military band leaders north of the Sahara and east of the&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop wasting our time and start playing!&#x201d;</p><p>So Nilly started playing. A warm, resounding melody welled up under the roof of the gymnasium and out the window on this warm fall afternoon. When they heard this beautiful music, the birds fell silent, feeling ashamed of their own songs. At least that&#x2019;s what Lisa was thinking as she sat there listening to her tiny neighbor and very best friend playing his grandfather&#x2019;s old trumpet. Lisa liked her clarinet, but somehow there was something special about the trumpet. And it wasn&#x2019;t that hard to play, either. Nilly had taught her to play one song on the trumpet, the Norwegian national anthem. Of course she didn&#x2019;t play it as well as Nilly, but secretly she dreamed that one day she would play <i>their</i> national anthem in front of a big audience. Imagine it! But imagining is imagining and dreaming is just dreaming.</p><p>&#x201c;Good, Nilly!&#x201d; called Mr. Madsen. &#x201c;And now let&#x2019;s all join in with Nilly! One, two, three!&#x201d;</p><p>And the D�lgen School Marching Band joined in. Staggered, tripped, and stumbled in. Drums, saxophones, French horn, glockenspiel, and cymbals. It sounded like someone had turned a kitchen upside down and now everything was tumbling out of the cupboards and drawers. Then the bass drum and tuba got going. The whole room started shaking. The wooden climbing bars on the wall started chattering, the ropes were hanging at an angle as if there were near gale force winds, and the worn pommel horse starting hopping across the floor, inching its way toward the exit as if it were trying to escape.</p><p>When they finally finished the Marseillaise, everything got quiet both inside the gym and out. No birds singing, no children laughing, just the echo of the evil twins&#x2019;&#x2014;Truls and Trym&#x2019;s&#x2014;final desperate blows to the drumheads and the eardrums.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Mr. Madsen moaned. &#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s enough for today. I&#x2019;ll see you guys on Monday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;M SERIOUS. THERE&#x2019;S something stranger about this new card!&#x201d; Lisa said as she and Nilly were walking home along Cannon Avenue. It was starting to get dark earlier as winter approached, and they liked that, especially Nilly. He thought the light summer nights they had this far north were a drag, kind of a below-average invention. But the warm, dark autumn nights with lots of darkness to provide cover for a little bit of neighborhood apple stealing&#x2014;that was a brilliant invention. Actually, it was almost as good as something Doctor Proctor might come up with. Because in Nilly&#x2019;s opinion, the professor was the best inventor in the world. True, the rest of the world didn&#x2019;t think Doctor Proctor had invented anything of any value, but what did they know? Who invented the strongest fart powder in the world, for example?</p><p>Of course, what was even more important was that Doctor Proctor made the best Jell-O in the world, he was the world&#x2019;s best friend and neighbor, and had taught Nilly and Lisa that they shouldn&#x2019;t let it bother them that the rest of the world thought they were a team of pathetic losers. A team consisting of a tiny boy with red sideburns, a timid girl with pigtails, and a much-crazier-than-average professor with sooty motorcycle goggles.</p><p>&#x201c;We know something they don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Proctor liked to say. &#x201c;We know that when friends promise never to stop helping each other, one plus one plus one is much more than three.&#x201d;</p><p>Truer words had never been spoken. But it had to be said that as a friend, the professor wasn&#x2019;t much of a letter writer. They had received only a couple of measly postcards in the three months that had passed since the professor had climbed on his motorcycle, put on his leather helmet, and said good-bye as he left Oslo to drive to Paris determined to find the great love of his life, Juliette Margarine.</p><p>Doctor Proctor had lost her under mysterious circumstances many, many years before when he had been a student in France. Lisa and Nilly had only seen the picture of Juliette, from back when she and Proctor had been dating, on the wall of the professor&#x2019;s lab. But they had looked so happy in the picture that it brought tears to Lisa&#x2019;s eyes. Lisa had actually been the one to convince Doctor Proctor to go back and look for her.</p><p>&#x201c;This one is <i>too</i> strange!&#x201d; Lisa insisted. &#x201c;Just look for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Nilly looked at the postcard she handed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Hm,&#x201d; he mumbled. He stopped right under the next streetlight and studied it intently while mumbling several <i>hm</i>s which all sounded thoughtful and intelligent.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Paris,&#x201d; Lisa said, pointing to the black-and-white picture that looked like it had been taken on an overcast morning. It showed a large, open square and aside from a bunch of people walking around with parasols and top hats, the square seemed strangely empty. The only way you could tell that it was actually the world-renowned capital of France was that the word PARIS was printed across the bottom of the picture.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you seeing what I&#x2019;m seeing?&#x201d; Nilly mumbled, lost in thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Which is what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That it seems like something is missing from this square. Well, I guess, I mean in the p...</p></p><h2>Thoughtful Alphabets: The Just Dessert and The Deadly Blotter</h2><p><i><li>Gorey&#x2019;s deft and witty use of language is apparent even in these twenty-six-word stories.</li><br><br><li>The book combines two of Gorey&#x2019;s Thoughtful Alphabets in one volume&#x2014;never before published in hardcover.</li></i><p><br>Astonishingly brief, captivating, decidedly engaging, for Goreyphiles: here.

In this book, Sanderson, a renowned zoologist with a keen interest in the paranormal, puts forward the curious theory that �&#x20ac;&#x153;OINTS"-Other Intelligences-live under the Earth�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s oceans. This underwater, parallel, civilization may be twice as old as Homo sapiens, he proposes, and may have �&#x20ac;&#x153;developed what we call space flight." Sanderson postulates that the OINTS are behind many UFO sightings as well as the mysterious disappearances of aircraft and ships in the Bermuda Triangle. What better place to have an impenetrable base than deep within the oceans of the planet? Yet, if UFOs, or at least some of them, are coming from beneath our oceans or lakes, does it necessarily mean that there is another civilization besides our own that is responsible? In fact, could it be that since WWII a number of underwater UFO bases have been constructed by the very human governments of our planet? Whatever their source, Sanderson offers here an exhaustive study of USOs (Unidentified Submarine Objects) observed in nearly every part of the world. He presents many well-documented and exciting case studies of these unusual sightings; more.</p><p>Ivan T. Sanderson was born in the UK and was a British Military Intelligence Officer during WWII.

In 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer&#x2014;the most notorious serial killer since Jack the Ripper&#x2014;seared himself into the American consciousness. To the public, Dahmer was a monster who committed unthinkable atrocities. To Derf Backderf, "Jeff" was a much more complex figure: a high school friend with whom he had shared classrooms, hallways, and car rides. In My Friend Dahmer, a haunting and original graphic novel, writer-artist Backderf creates a surprisingly sympathetic portrait of a disturbed young man struggling against the morbid urges emanating from the deep recesses of his psyche&#x2014;a shy kid, a teenage alcoholic, and a goofball who never quite fit in with his classmates. With profound insight, what emerges is a Jeffrey Dahmer that few ever really knew, and one readers will never forget.<br> &nbsp;<br> Also available by Derf Backderf, <i>Trashed</i>.<br><br> Find teaching guides for <i>My Friend Dahmer </i>and other titles at abramsbooks.com/resources.</p><p><b>Derf Backderf</b> has been nominated for two Eisner Awards and has received a host of honors, including the prestigious Robert F.

Highly recommended for professionals as well as true crime readers. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>This isn't a cautionary tale. It's insight shared insight arriving too late to save Dahmer's victims, let alone Jeff himself, but perhaps soon enough to remind both teens and their caretakers that questioning peculiar behavior might be a better tack than ignoring or exploiting it.

What would happen if we rethought the macho, outdated version of manhood, and embraced a different ideal?&nbsp;In&nbsp;the current atmosphere of bullying, intolerance and misogyny, demonstrated in the recent Trump versus Clinton presidential campaign,&nbsp;<i>The Descent of Man&nbsp;</i>is a timely and essential addition to current conversations around gender.&nbsp;<br><br>Apart from gaining vast new wardrobe options, the real benefit might be that a newly fitted masculinity will allow men to have better relationships&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s happiness, right? Grayson Perry admits he&#x2019;s not immune from the stereotypes himself&#x2014;yet his thoughts on everything from power to physical appearance, from emotions to a brand new Manifesto for Men, are shot through with honesty, tenderness, and the belief that, for everyone to benefit, updating masculinity has to be something men decide to do themselves.

Halfway up I see a young boy, maybe nine or ten years old. He is struggling; this track is a tough challenge for anyone not used to mountain &nbsp;biking, let alone a kid on a new bicycle.

I have seen that father&#x2019;s face on a thousand soc- cer sidelines, outside a thousand school gates. It&#x2019;s a face that says, &#x201c;Toughen &nbsp;up, don&#x2019;t whine, be a man!&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the face of someone who hands down the rage and pain of what it is to be a man. I feel incensed on the boy&#x2019;s behalf. I can&#x2019;t help myself: I say to the father, &#x201c;I hope your son can afford a good psycho- therapist when he grows up.&#x201d; The father doesn&#x2019;t respond.</p><p>I hope &nbsp;that &nbsp;in &nbsp;picking &nbsp;up &nbsp;this book you have already acknowledged that masculinity needs to be questioned, &nbsp;that</p><p>gender &nbsp;inequality &nbsp;is a huge &nbsp;issue for all of us and that the</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>world would be a better place without &nbsp;it. What I hope &nbsp;this small &nbsp;book &nbsp;might &nbsp;do &nbsp;is bring &nbsp;awareness &nbsp;of masculinity &nbsp;to more &nbsp;people-awareness being &nbsp;a &nbsp;step &nbsp;toward &nbsp;change, &nbsp;be� cause &nbsp;many forms of masculinity can &nbsp;be very destructive. If this is the first book you have bought about &nbsp;gender, I am &nbsp;joy� ful. &nbsp;We &nbsp;need &nbsp;to examine &nbsp;masculinity, not &nbsp;just to &nbsp;prevent small boys from crying with rage at their impassive fathers on a mountain-bike ride, but to change &nbsp;the whole world for the better.</p><p>Examining masculinity can seem like a luxury problem, a pastime for a wealthy, well-educated, peaceful society, but I would argue the opposite: the poorer, the more undeveloped, the more uneducated a society is, the more masculinity needs realigning with &nbsp;the &nbsp;modern world, &nbsp;because &nbsp;masculinity &nbsp;is probably holding &nbsp;back that society. All over the globe, crimes are committed, wars are started, &nbsp;women &nbsp;are being held back and economies are disastrously distorted &nbsp;by men, &nbsp;because &nbsp;of their outdated version of masculinity.</p><p>We need to get a philosophical fingernail &nbsp;under the edge of the &nbsp;firmly &nbsp;stuck-down &nbsp;masculinity sticker &nbsp;so we can &nbsp;get hold of it and &nbsp;rip it off. Beneath &nbsp;the sticker, men &nbsp;are &nbsp;naked and vulnerable-human even.</p><p>It is a newsroom &nbsp;cliche &nbsp;that &nbsp;masculinity is always some� how "in crisis," under &nbsp;threat &nbsp;from pollutants such as shifting gender &nbsp;roles, but to me &nbsp;many &nbsp;aspects &nbsp;of masculinity seem such a blight on society that to say it is "in crisis" is like saying racism was "in crisis" in civil-rights-era America. Masculinity needs &nbsp;to change. Some may question &nbsp;this, but they are often white middle-class &nbsp;men &nbsp;with nice &nbsp;jobs and nice families: the current state of masculinity works for them. &nbsp;What &nbsp;about all the &nbsp;teenagers &nbsp;who think &nbsp;the only manly &nbsp;way out of poverty</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>and dysfunction is to become &nbsp;a criminal? What about all the lonely &nbsp;men &nbsp;who &nbsp;can't &nbsp;get &nbsp;a &nbsp;partner, &nbsp;have &nbsp;trouble &nbsp;making friends &nbsp;and &nbsp;end &nbsp;up killing &nbsp;themselves? &nbsp;What about &nbsp;all &nbsp;the angry men &nbsp;who inflict their masculine baggage onto the rest of us? All of us males need to look at ourselves with a clear eye and &nbsp;ask what &nbsp;sort &nbsp;of men &nbsp;would &nbsp;make &nbsp;the &nbsp;world a &nbsp;better place, for everyone.</p><p>When we think &nbsp;about &nbsp;masculinity and &nbsp;men, &nbsp;the &nbsp;issues</p><p>can quickly &nbsp;become &nbsp;scarily global and serious. A discussion about &nbsp;hipster &nbsp;fashions or who does the &nbsp;washing-up &nbsp;can &nbsp;rap� idly spiral into a debate &nbsp;about &nbsp;rape, war, terrorism, &nbsp;religious oppression &nbsp;and &nbsp;predatory &nbsp;capitalism. I sometimes watch the evening &nbsp;news on television and think all the world's problems can be boiled down to one thing: the behavior of people with a Y chromosome. Men seem &nbsp;to be the ones with the &nbsp;power, the money, the guns and the criminal records. The &nbsp;conse� quences &nbsp;of rogue masculinity are, I think, one of the &nbsp;biggest issues, if not the &nbsp;biggest issue, facing the&nbsp; world today. Some forms of masculinity-particularly if starkly brutal or covertly domineering-are toxic to an equal,&nbsp; free and tolerant society.</p><p>Understandably, women have led the discussion about gender. &nbsp;They are the ones who have been &nbsp;most oppressed &nbsp;by its constraints, after all. On the subject of gender, the feelings of many men can &nbsp;be summed up as "If it ain't &nbsp;broke, don't fix it"; the &nbsp;status quo &nbsp;seems &nbsp;to work for them. &nbsp;But I &nbsp;am&nbsp; asking, "Does &nbsp;it? Really?" What if half the victims of masculinity are men? Masculinity might be a straitjacket &nbsp;that is keeping men from "being themselves," whatever that might mean. &nbsp;In their drive for domination, men &nbsp;may have neglected &nbsp;to prioritize vital aspects of being wholly human, particularly issues around mental health. In their drive to be successfully masculine, men</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>may be preventing their greater self from &nbsp;being successfully happy. I want to unpack what the American feminist Peggy Mcintosh calls the "invisible weightless knapsack" of male priv� ilege, full of "special &nbsp;provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks," to see if it is as much &nbsp;a burden to some men as a boon.</p><p>I feel I need to say here that in no way am I setting myself against men in general, &nbsp;not least because &nbsp;I am one. &nbsp;Nor am I against all masculinity: I can be as masculine as the next guy. This &nbsp;book is about what I think &nbsp;masculinity is, and question� ing it. One of the problems when talking about masculinity is the confusion between sex (male) and gender (man). The physical, definite, &nbsp;pretty &nbsp;much &nbsp;unchanging fact of the&nbsp; male body can &nbsp;make &nbsp;us think &nbsp;that all the &nbsp;behaviors, &nbsp;feelings&nbsp; and culture associated &nbsp;with &nbsp;that &nbsp;body (masculinity) are also im� mutably &nbsp;writ in flesh. For many males, being masculine, act� ing in a manly &nbsp;way, is as unquestionably a biological &nbsp;part of them &nbsp;as their penis &nbsp;and testicles and deep voice. But mascu� linity &nbsp;is mainly &nbsp;a set of habits, &nbsp;traditions &nbsp;and &nbsp;beliefs histori� cally associated with being a man. Our bodies take tens of millennia to evolve even slightly, but behaviors &nbsp;seen as mas� culine can &nbsp;be as transient as a teenage &nbsp;fad, a coal mine &nbsp;or a forgotten &nbsp;deity. We need to shift away from seeing masculin� ity as a closed set of behaviors and from seeing change &nbsp;as threatening, unnatural and &nbsp;feminizing. I see masculinity as being how men &nbsp;behave at present. &nbsp;I think &nbsp;it needs &nbsp;to change to include &nbsp;behaviors that are at present regarded &nbsp;by many as feminine, behaviors &nbsp;that &nbsp;are &nbsp;sensible, &nbsp;life-enhancing &nbsp;and planet-saving.</p><p>I can't &nbsp;remember &nbsp;the &nbsp;first time &nbsp;I realized &nbsp;I &nbsp;was male, &nbsp;I</p><p>doubt &nbsp;many men can, but that is at the nub of masculinity; it</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>is there &nbsp;at the very basement level of our identity. &nbsp;Before we learn to speak or understand language, we are being indoctri� nated &nbsp;in &nbsp;gender. &nbsp;The &nbsp;first question most &nbsp;people &nbsp;ask when they hear of a birth is "Is it a boy or a girl?" Once &nbsp;we know the sex of a baby, we often coo over it in gendered &nbsp;ways: "Isn't she beautiful?"; &nbsp;"Look &nbsp;at &nbsp;him &nbsp;kick, he's &nbsp;going &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;a &nbsp;soccer player."</p><p>So masculinity is a deeply woven component of the male</p><p>psyche. But I am a transvestite; I am turned &nbsp;on by dressing up in clothes that are heavily associated with being female. This is perhaps some &nbsp;unconscious renunciation of being a man, or at least a fantasy flight toward femininity. &nbsp;I sometimes like to pretend &nbsp;I &nbsp;am a woman, so from &nbsp;a young&nbsp; age I have felt that masculinity is optional &nbsp;for someone &nbsp;with a penis. &nbsp;Because &nbsp;I am&nbsp; a transvestite, people often &nbsp;assume &nbsp;that &nbsp;this gives me &nbsp;a special &nbsp;insight &nbsp;into the &nbsp;opposite gender. &nbsp;But this is rubbish. How can &nbsp;I, brought &nbsp;up as a man, &nbsp;know anything about &nbsp;the experience of being a woman? It would be insulting to women if I &nbsp;thought I did. If anything, it gives me a sharper &nbsp;insight into what it is to be a man, since from the age of twelve I have been &nbsp;intensely &nbsp;questioning my own &nbsp;masculinity. &nbsp;I have had to step slightly &nbsp;outside &nbsp;myself, a doubter &nbsp;at the &nbsp;gates of the crumbling superdome of masculinity. &nbsp;This &nbsp;does &nbsp;not &nbsp;mean that I have stepped &nbsp;into femininity, but it is no surprise&nbsp; that I am &nbsp;thoroughly fascinated&nbsp; &nbsp;by &nbsp;masculinity, &nbsp;the &nbsp;lumbering beast &nbsp;within &nbsp;me that &nbsp;I &nbsp;have tried &nbsp;to suppress &nbsp;and &nbsp;negotiate with my entire &nbsp;life. I have been forced by my sexuality to be� come aware of what it is to be a "man."</p><p>As a &nbsp;twelve-year-old &nbsp;rummaging in &nbsp;my &nbsp;mother's &nbsp;ward� robe, I felt dangerously &nbsp;weird and alone. I didn't even&nbsp; know that such a thing as transvestism existed or that other men felt</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>the same. This&nbsp; feeling prompted &nbsp;the&nbsp; thought that masculin� ity is an act played out blindly by many men who have had no reason &nbsp;or impulse &nbsp;to question what it is they are doing. &nbsp;One thing I &nbsp;discovered &nbsp;in &nbsp;investigating the&nbsp; nature &nbsp;of identity &nbsp;for my TV series and &nbsp;London exhibition &nbsp;<i>Who Are You? </i>was that identity &nbsp;is an ongoing performance, not a static &nbsp;state. &nbsp;The philosopher Julian &nbsp;Baggini wrote that "Tis a verb masquer� ading as a noun."</p><p>I can't &nbsp;remember a time &nbsp;when &nbsp;I &nbsp;embraced being a man fully, unquestioningly. I &nbsp;am a white man, a rather &nbsp;tarnished badge &nbsp;to wear these days, weighted &nbsp;with guilt &nbsp;and shame &nbsp;at the behavior of one's fellows. Manliness &nbsp;for my young self was problematic. Somewhere &nbsp;there &nbsp;was always a nagging &nbsp;suspi� cion that masculinity was inherently wrong and needed &nbsp;to be controlled. My mother &nbsp;used me, her eldest son, as a sounding board to vent all her rage against men. By the age of fifteen, I had &nbsp;taken &nbsp;on &nbsp;board &nbsp;a heap &nbsp;of anti-male &nbsp;propaganda. Even today &nbsp;I &nbsp;often &nbsp;catch &nbsp;myself observing &nbsp;and &nbsp;commenting on men as if I were not one of them. Most men are nice, reason� able fellows. But most violent &nbsp;people, rapists, criminals, kill� ers, tax avoiders, corrupt politicians, planet despoilers, sex abusers and dinner-party bores do tend to be, well ... men.</p><p>I did not have good role models. My father left when I was just four years old, and &nbsp;I didn't &nbsp;really have any meaningful contact with &nbsp;him &nbsp;until &nbsp;I &nbsp;was fifteen, &nbsp;by which &nbsp;time &nbsp;I was pretty &nbsp;well hardwired &nbsp;with &nbsp;my own &nbsp;version &nbsp;of masculinity and &nbsp;its attendant sexuality, something that &nbsp;I still have forty years later. My stepfather, with whom I lived for the majority of my childhood, was a volatile and violent &nbsp;man &nbsp;of whom &nbsp;I was terrified. So men were unreliable, brutish, distant &nbsp;and uninterested in me. I have suffered at the hands &nbsp;of individual</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><br><p></p><p>men &nbsp;and &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;constraints of gender &nbsp;itself. I am &nbsp;a male person, and&nbsp; I have learned &nbsp;to have some compassion for my� self and hope to have compassion for males in general. &nbsp;I write this book with goodwill &nbsp;and in the&nbsp; hope that men &nbsp;will learn to flourish in a changing world.</p><p>This &nbsp;is not about &nbsp;writing men off: one &nbsp;thing &nbsp;that writing this book has made me realize is that, despite my gender dys� phoria, &nbsp;I &nbsp;can &nbsp;be a very traditionally &nbsp;masculine man. &nbsp;There is a corny saying in therapy circles, "If you spot it, you've got it;' &nbsp;which &nbsp;means &nbsp;that &nbsp;if you &nbsp;notice &nbsp;behavior &nbsp;in &nbsp;others, &nbsp;it's probably because &nbsp;you behave &nbsp;in the same &nbsp;way. I have been masculinity-spotting for quite a while now, and note I display quite acutely some of the&nbsp; traits we associate with &nbsp;men. &nbsp;I am very &nbsp;competitive &nbsp;and &nbsp;territorial,&nbsp; &nbsp;particularly &nbsp;toward &nbsp;other men. I often ask other men &nbsp;about this and &nbsp;they usually deny bristling at rivals or having any other such man moments, which leaves me feeling like I &nbsp;am a macho monster for admitting &nbsp;to wanting to get one over on other guys in petty ways. Maybe my circumstances, being a transvestite and an artist, mean that I am less invested in society's ideals of masculinity&nbsp; than &nbsp;many men and that therefore I am &nbsp;willing to pick them &nbsp;out and question them, even in myself. I feel I have nothing to lose but some anti� social habits.</p><p>When I was growing &nbsp;up, my unconscious dealt &nbsp;with the issue of masculinity in a very particular way: it handed &nbsp;the role over to my teddy bear. Maybe at some level I sensed that being fully the man I could be was dangerous in a house with my...</p></p><h2>A Lucky Luke Adventure - Ma Dalton</h2><p>Lucky Luke makes the acquaintance of <b><i>Ma Dalton</i></b> at Cactus Junction, and he quickly realizes that the saying, 'like mother, like son' has never been so true!

They call it &#34;the 9th Art.&#34; Every year, a thriving international festival takes place at Angoul�me (France) to celebrate graphic novels, a popular art form as well respected as any literary genre. In fact, there are all kinds of BD for both adults and children. They are available everywhere from the village bookshop to the supermarket via cultural media stores like La FNAC or Virgin. Conscious that the English reading public at large was not properly aware of BD, and out of admiration for the work of Goscinny (the author of Asterix), we decided to start with another of his characters: Lucky Luke. Lucky Luke is this super cool cowboy who, with his wisecracking horse Jolly Jumper, protects the population West of the Mississippi from the exaction of all kinds of villains, some real (The Daltons, Jesse James) and some invented. The stories, always well researched, combine fact, fiction and humorous send off with a refreshing lack of political correctness. So far, we have published seven titles titles - Calamity Jane, Jesse James, Dalton City, The Tenderfoot, Ma Dalton, Western Circus and The Dashing White Cowboy. In total, there are over 60 Lucky Luke titles. An amazing success story worldwide for the last 50 years, there are 250 million Lucky Luke books in print in over 26 languages worldwide. From our research, the ecstatic response to the BD by British children proved beyond any doubt that these books deserve to be read by English speakers and that English speaking children deserve the opportunity to read them. Glo&#39;worm sets out to give them this opportunity.The character of Lucky Luke became a myth thanks to Morris (his creator) and Goscinny. These two giants of the 9th art collaborated with passion for more than 20 years until the death of the famous scriptwriter. Goscinny is the author of the well-known Ast�rix, which he launched with Uderzo. He also co-authored Iznogoud with Tabary. In 1992, Morris received the &#39;Grand Prix Sp�cial 20�me Anniversaire&#39; from the international comics show at Angoul�me, and in 1998, the French Minister of Culture decorated him with the rank of &#39;Officier des Arts et des Lettres&#39;.</p><h2>Zen Attitude (The Rei Shimura Series, 2)</h2><p><p>Life in modern Tokyo is a blast for Rei Shimura, a young Japanese-American woman who enjoys busy days as an antiques dealer and steamy nights with a devoted new boyfriend. But things come to a standstill when Rei overpays for a rare old chest of drawers for a wealthy client, the owner of a famous Zen temple in Kamakura. The exquisite <i>tansu</i> turns out to be a fake: the worst deal Rei has ever made. When the temple family turns on Rei - and the con man who sold the <i>tansu</i> is murdered - she realizes she's opened a Pandora's box of deception and murder. A young martial artist, an aspiring rock singer, and an elderly antiques mentor all become part of Rei's search for the killer through the shadows of an ancient culture. As her world begins to rapidly and inexplicably unravel, Rei realizes that it will take strength, wit, and a Zen attitude to survive.</p></p><p><p>Sujata Massey was a reporter for the <em>Baltimore Evening Sun</em> and spent several years in Japan teaching English and studying Japanese. She is the author of <em>The Salaryman's Wife, Zen Attitude, The Flower Master, The Floating Girl, The Bride's Kimono, The Samurai's Daughter, The Pearl Diver,</em> and <em>The Typhoon Lover</em>. She lives in Minneapolis. </p>Rei Shimura, the Tokyo-based, Japanese-American freelance antiques buyer whom smart mystery fans will remember from The Salaryman's Wife, finds herself the owner of an overpriced, ersatz Edo-period tansu. Bad karma comes with this to-die-for chest of drawers, and Rei becomes, in rapid succession, murder suspect, then murder target. Stuck with bad goods, financial losses and a relationship frayed around the edges, she skips out on her boyfriend and his luxurious lifestyle, and ends up befriended by ex-judo champ Akemi Mihori, who offers her a place to stay on the grounds of the famous Zen temple Horin-ji. Exhausted, scared and a little malnourished, Rei battles growing paranoia that leads her to confuse friend and murderous foe. As with her first novel, Massey manages to combine a very entertaining mystery with lessons in Japanese culture.

Exploring the social and theological milieu of the period, the author demonstrates the essentially Christian nature of Cunning practices, presenting an illuminating discourse on the concept of magic and its perceived methodologies.</p><p>Operating at the boundaries of the law and society, between medicine and magic, Cunning men and women occupied a liminal role as healers, charmers and magicians. Drawing from a huge range of sources, the range of services offered by Cunning Folk is thoroughly expounded, from divination through astrology and geomancy to dream interpretation, from charms, spells and curses to conjurations and treasure hunting. As author Jim Baker states, "The focus here is on the practice of folk magic and divination for access to the preternatural".</p><p>The evolution of Cunning practices as a living tradition over a 350-year span is explored in depth, illustrating their practical and contemporary nature. The analogous practices of African-American conjure and root work are also discussed and offer insights into oral fragments of Cunning practices lost to history, presenting a compelling example of how modernity modifies tradition. Referencing dozens of Cunning men and women and their practices, this work offers a unique glimpse into magical history, and the opportunity for readers to reclaim the practical essence of Cunning Magic.</p></p><p>Jim Baker is a historian living in USA.<p>This is truly an amazing book! As someone who is very interested in 'folk magic' and Folklore I found Baker's compilation of the such information both fascinating and invaluable in increasing our understand of this important, yet rather neglected, area of British history.<em> - Ayon707, Amazon reviewer</em></p></p><h2>Best.

But what dictates <i>how</i> something grows--from the division of cells in a human being to the fractal patterns of a crystal? <br> <br>Massimo Citro reveals that behind the complex world of Nature lies a basic code, a universal information field--also known as the Akashic field, which records all that was, is, and will be--that directs not only physical development and behavior but also energetic communication and interactions among all living and non-living things.

But what dictates <em>how</em> something grows--from the division of cells in a human being to the fractal patterns of a crystal? <br> <br>Massimo Citro reveals that behind the complex world of Nature lies a basic code, a universal information field--also known as the Akashic field, which records all that was, is, and will be. This basic code directs not only physical development and behavior but also energetic communication and interactions among all living and non-living things.

The writing, which has all the edgy darkness of the best street lit, sometimes mimics the bar&#x2019;s background jazz in its syncopation and the occasional quick-burst, broken-sentence, run-on format, with the bar regulars feeling like a Greek chorus." &#x2015; <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong> (<strong>Starred Review</strong>)<br><br>"If his portrait of Congo makes it appear socially and politically hopeless, what's hopeful is the spirit of his writing, which crackles and leaps with energy. Rather than moralize, he transfigures harsh reality with a bounding, inventive, bebop-style prose, translated from the French with light-footed skill by Roland Glasser." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>John Powers, NPR's Fresh Air w/ Terry Gross</strong><br><br>"Stylistically quirky and unorthodox fiction from Africa...Tram 83 is the locus of those driven by ambition, desire, greed, or pleasure&#x2015;and in this underworld we meet quite a cast of characters." &#x2015;<em><strong>Kirkus Reviews</strong></em><br><br>"Deeply allusive . . . most original about <em>Tram 83</em> is its conscious application of a music no longer of the avant-garde &#x2013; a normalized music &#x2013; to sing of modern Africa.

Somehow epic, intimate, and morally complex at the same time." &#x2015; <strong>Jonny Diamond, <em>The Literary Hub</em> (Best Books of 2015)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Energetically written Congolese satire that goes dark and funny in its depiction of a city-state around a mine where everything and everybody is for sale, neoliberalism on full-blast.&#x201d; &#x2015; <strong>Jace Clayton (DJ Rupture), <em>Dwarf + Giant</em></strong><br><br>The expressive and elegiac prose makes the seediness so palpable, the poverty so tangible, the darkness and debauchery so intense, yet it does not reach the point of despair." &#x2015; <strong><em>The Deccan Herald</em></strong><br><br>"Mujila employs the logic of poetry &#x2013; to evoke a febrile eternal present. It's bustling, strange experimental fiction in which the chaos of daily life leaks like blood from the iron fist of violence and profit." &#x2015; <strong>Cameron Woodhead, <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></strong> (<strong>Pick of the Week</strong>)<br><br>"With echoes of Flannery O&#x2019;Connor, Ralph Ellison, and Joseph Conrad, Mujila&#x2019;s language alchemizes epic poetry from violence, despair and distraction. He bebops in broken time with words and structure, improvising and free-associating." &#x2015;<strong>Michelle Newby, <em>The Rumpus</em></strong><br><br>"A frenetic writing style, like that of a jazz musician, gives this Africa-set novel an enthusiastic, adventurous energy . . . Tram 83 isn&#x2018;t for the faint of heart, but rather, it&#x2019;s for those that have a sense of humor, an interest in seedy underbellies, and a willingness to, at times, feel a little lost in the haze of biblical imagery, flippant debauchery, free sex, and anarchy. Ezra Pound would be proud; Mujila 'made it new.'" &#x2015; <strong>Josh Cook, <em>Foreword Reviews</em></strong><br><br>"As a meditation or debauch on the nothing that is left behind when everything falls apart, <em>Tram 83</em> is a literary manifesto, or at least a literary revelation. Its ambition has to be seen in the context of African literature&#x2019;s predicament: if African literature is in need of saving&#x2015;as critics regularly contend that it is&#x2015;then this might be a book you could turn to as salvation." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>Aaron Bady, <em>Guernica</em></strong><br><br>"Mujila's writing is at once quirky and dark, frenetic and melodic. Some passages seem pulled out of a somewhat comedic noir novel while others rival David Foster Wallace's best paragraphs, both in complexity and length. . . . Tram 83, while a novel about Africa, is also a novel about the world and a text that perfectly exemplifies the global village imagined by philosopher and communication theorist Marshall McLuhan; a place where travel and technology contribute to bringing the world together in a physical, as well as a cultural, way." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>Gabino Iglesias, <em>The Collagist</em></strong><br><br>"<em>Tram 83</em> is political commentary in haute creative form...the novel comes to you vividly as a melange of spoken word and <em>lisapo</em> in the form of Congolese oral tradition, as though you are sat around a fire in the quiet night listening to the seasoned voice of the village elder as the embers flicker into the air and paints the scenes before your eyes. <em>Tram 83</em> is the harmony of Papa Wemba, the rhythm of Franco Luambo and the art of Eddy Kamounga Ilunga in literary form; you cannot help but either be arrested or moved by it. It resonates so deeply with Patrice Lumumba&#x2019;s message and that of <em>lipanda</em> (independence); write your own story. The independence of Congo was not just a political move, but also one relating to its culture, creativity and arts. To write your story and celebrate your artists is to crystallise the experience of a generation so that it may be passed on to the next, and never be forgotten or taken away as it once was. It is an act of self-determination, a discovery of self, which we are beginning to see once again in its finest form." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>JJ Bola, poet and author of <em>WORD</em></strong><br><br>"TRAM 83 reads like a modern, twisted <em>The Great Gatsby</em> . . . eccentric and somewhat disturbing, yet inclusive and universally appealing." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>Caitlin Thomas, <em>Three Percent</em></strong><br><br>"The prose is visceral, as sensuous and vivid as a live performance.&#x201d; &#x2015; <strong>Merin McDivitt, <em>Michigan Daily</em></strong><br><br>"Dazzling . . . a fascinating read that oscillates between gripping dystopia and humanist celebration." &#x2015;&nbsp;<strong>Pedro Monaville, <em>Africa is a Country</em></strong><br><br>"Spiky, quirky and edgy . . . Mujila serves up predators' delight." &#x2015; <strong>Mark Thomas, <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em></strong><br><br>"Exuberant, with an additive style . . . a formally engaging book that mimics both the structures of jazz and the sense of overhearing conversation in a bar." &#x2015; <strong><em>The Saturday Paper</em></strong> (Australia)<br><br>&#x201c;<em>Tram 83</em> is driven more by language, rhythm and atmosphere &#x2015; and, most important, how all of these mix, dissolve and reconfigure in consciousness. . . . the book confronts the myopic view that literature (or industry) could &#x201c;fix&#x201d; or &#x201c;redeem&#x201d; Africa.

Parker, <em>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</em></strong><br><br>"As much a musical work as it is a fictional one." &#x2015;<strong>Geoff Wisner, <em>The Quarterly Conversation</em></strong><br><br>"A literary mixtape of a book. Mujilla utilizes everything from science fiction&#x2019;s alienating style, which often features protagonists grappling to understand a brave new world just as readers must grapple with the head-spinning array of baby chicks, single mamas, students, diggers and tourists of the City-State, to the profane energy of the beat&#x2019;s drug-induced, maniacal prose stylings. Add a bit of theatre of the absurd and, of course, poetry, and you have one hell of a read." &#x2015; <strong>Jennifer Smart, <em>Dallas Observer</em></strong><br><br>"Loud and garish, <em>Tram 83</em> pushes towards overwhelming the senses. . . . Playful, even with all its dark edges, <em>Tram 83</em> is a different kind of modern urban novel -- City-State so alien and removed (it is very much a city apart) that much of this feels closer (especially in Mwanza Mujila's presentation) to dystopic science fiction than the usual gritty realism." &#x2015; <strong>Michael Orthofer, <em>The Complete Review</em></strong><br><br>"Mujila&#x2019;s transcription of the &#x201c;City State&#x201d; is, literally, stunning, even as one must feel stunned when sitting amid the jazzy uproar and underhand dealings of the seedy nightclub. How can so much sordidness, aggressiveness, and disastrous human interaction be so captivating &#x2015; and sometimes amusing? . . . through Roland Glasser&#x2019;s lively translation, Mujila tells a dynamic, sometimes scabrous, sometimes satirical story with political and economic underpinnings." &#x2015; <strong>John Taylor, <em>The Arts Fuse</em></strong><br><br>"A superb novel, without doubt the noisiest novel I have ever read, and one that will clearly set the African novel on a new path." &#x2015; <strong><em>The Modern Novel</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Talk about verve&#x2015;and vivre: Fiston Mwanza Mujila&#x2019;s <em>Tram 83</em> introduces a rousing, remarkable new voice to this world, surely in its original French, most definitely in Roland Glasser&#x2019;s superb translation.This book has drive and force and movement, it has hops and chops. It has voices! . . .

Native peoples fully recognized the potential of firearms to assist them in their struggles against colonial forces, and mostly against one another.</p><p>The smoothbore, flintlock musket was Indians&#x2019; stock firearm, and its destructive potential transformed their lives. For the deer hunters east of the Mississippi, the gun evolved into an essential hunting tool. Most importantly, well-armed tribes were able to capture and enslave their neighbors, plunder wealth, and conquer territory. Arms races erupted across North America, intensifying intertribal rivalries and solidifying the importance of firearms in Indian politics and culture.</p><p>Though American tribes grew dependent on guns manufactured in Europe and the United States, their dependence never prevented them from rising up against Euro-American power. The Seminoles, Blackfeet, Lakotas, and others remained formidably armed right up to the time of their subjugation. Far from being a Trojan horse for colonialism, firearms empowered American Indians to pursue their interests and defend their political and economic autonomy over two centuries.</p></p><p>David J. Silverman is Professor of History at George Washington University.&#x201c;Silverman&#x2019;s compelling rediscovery of the &#x2018;gun frontier,&#x2019; imaginatively conceived and deeply researched, is must reading. For nearly two centuries, indigenous peoples everywhere in North America waged devastating arms races with each other, enabled by, but seldom under the control of, Euro-Americans eager to sell their lethal wares in defiance of laws and their nations&#x2019; interests.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Daniel K. Richter, author of <i>Before the Revolution: America&#x2019;s Ancient Pasts</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;After reading <i>Thundersticks</i>, no one will ever be able to question that guns were fundamental to colonialism and that American Indians wanted them, used them with ferocity, and that they changed Native life forever. Silverman makes it all so obvious in his utterly convincing and transformative book. He has literally rewritten American history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robbie Ethridge, author of <i>From Chicaza to Chickasaw: The European Invasion and the Transformation of the Mississippian World, 1540&#x2013;1715</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Tracking the impact of firearms across different eras and areas as Native peoples incorporated them into their arsenals, economies, foreign policies, and cultures, David Silverman shows how guns shaped the colonial and indigenous history of the continent.

Stranger still: Adams learned there is an entire global sub-culture of amateur explorers who are still actively and obsessively searching for this sunken city, based entirely on Plato&#x2019;s detailed clues.&nbsp; What Adams didn&#x2019;t realize was that Atlantis is kind of like a virus&#x2014;and he&#x2019;d been exposed.&nbsp; <br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Meet Me in Atlantis</i>, Adams&nbsp;racks up frequent-flier miles tracking down these Atlantis obsessives, trying to determine why they believe it's possible to find the world's most famous lost city&#x2014;and whether any of their theories could prove or disprove its existence.

Our destination was an unremarkable set of prehistoric ruins. The shared interest&#x2014;about the only thing we had in common&#x2014;that had brought Michael H�bner and me together in Morocco for what felt like a very awkward second date was Atlantis. H�bner was certain he had found it.</p><p>H�bner was far from alone in this belief. I&#x2019;d already met plenty of other enthusiastic Atlantis seekers who&#x2019;d used clues gleaned from Renaissance maps or obscure Babylonian myths or unpublished documents from the Vatican Secret Archives to pinpoint its supposed location. There did not seem to be a lot of consensus. Morocco was the eighth country on three continents that I&#x2019;d visited as I pursued those who pursued Atlantis, the legendary lost city. I&#x2019;d become as fascinated by them as they were by their quest. I hadn&#x2019;t seen my wife and children for a month.</p><p>H�bner&#x2019;s unique search strategy was data analysis. He had scoured ancient literature for every mention of Atlantis that he could find and then plugged that data into an algorithm far too complicated for a math novice like me to understand. His results were clear, though. According to his calculations and the laws of probability, the capital city of Atlantis had absolutely, positively existed just a few hundred feet ahead at the nexus of GPS coordinates we were tracking. &#x201c;It is very, very improbable that all these criteria are combined by chance in one area,&#x201d; he had already told me several times, his monotone voice betraying not the slightest doubt.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t so sure. Perhaps the defining characteristic of the landscape around us, the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, was its complete lack of water. Twice on the way here my driver had slammed on the brakes to avoid crashing into herds of camels crossing the road. The one thing that everyone knows about the legend of Atlantis is that it sank beneath the seas.</p><p>H�bner had a ready explanation for this aquatic discrepancy. An earthquake in the Atlantic Ocean, a few miles west of where we were hiking, had caused a tsunami that had flooded the Moroccan coast and then receded. The ancient story of this deluge had simply gotten garbled over generations of retelling.</p><p>A few months earlier, I would have said H�bner&#x2019;s explanation sounded crazy. Now it had a very familiar ring to it. I had heard a lot of location hypotheses that hinged on tsunamis and other improbable agents: volcanic explosions, mistranslated hieroglyphics, the ten biblical plagues, asteroid impacts, Bronze Age transatlantic cocaine trafficking, and the Pythagorean theorem.</p><p>All of these ideas had been presented to me by intelligent, sincere people who had devoted large chunks of their lives to searching for a city that most reputable scientists dismissed as a fairy tale. Most of the university experts I&#x2019;d approached about Atlantis had equated the futility of searching for it with hunting down the specific pot of gold that a certain leprechaun had left at the end of a particular rainbow. Now I was starting to wonder if I&#x2019;d been away from home too long&#x2014;because the more of these Atlantis seekers I met, the more their cataclysmic hypotheses made sense.</p><p>Perhaps the second most famous attribute of Atlantis was its distinctive circular shape, an island city surrounded by alternating rings of land and water. At the center of those rings, the story went, stood a magnificent temple dedicated to the Greek god Poseidon. That innermost island, with its evidence of an advanced civilization suddenly destroyed by a watery disaster, was the proof that every Atlantis hunter most longed to find. Incredibly, this legendary island&#x2019;s precise measurements, as well as the dimensions of the temple and the city&#x2019;s distance from the sea, had been handed down from the philosopher Plato, one of the greatest thinkers in Western history. The clues to solving this riddle had been available for more than two thousand years, but no one had yet found a convincing answer. H�bner insisted that according to his own calculations, what we were about to see was close to a perfect match.</p><p>H�bner wasn&#x2019;t an especially chatty guy, so we trudged silently up the slope, the only sounds coming from our feet scraping the sunbaked ground and the occasional bleating of stray goats. Finally, the incline leveled off and we looked out onto a large geological depression, a sort of desert basin enclosed on all sides. I leaned against a leafless tree and wiped sweat from my eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;You remember how I showed you the satellite photo, how it was like a ring?&#x201d; H�bner said, waving his hand across the panorama. &#x201c;That is this place here.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course I remembered. The image he&#x2019;d shown me on his computer screen was like a treasure map leading to Atlantis; it was that photo that had convinced me to come to Morocco. I scanned the horizon from left to right and slowly recognized that we were standing above a natural bowl, almost perfectly round. In the middle was a large hill, also circular&#x2014;a ring within a ring.</p><p>&#x201c;On that hill in the center is where I found the ruins of the gigantic temple,&#x201d; H�bner said. &#x201c;You can check for yourself the measurements. They are almost exact with the story of Atlantis.&#x201d; He sipped from his water bottle. &#x201c;I would like to show this to you. Do you think maybe we should go down there?&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>New York, New York</p><p>A few years ago, for reasons that presumably made sense at the time, a friend who worked at a popular women&#x2019;s magazine called to ask if I&#x2019;d consider taking on an unusual writing assignment. Might I be interested in compiling a list of the greatest philosophers of all time and explaining, in easily digestible chunks, why their work was relevant to America&#x2019;s working mothers?</p><p>Having dropped the one philosophy course I&#x2019;d signed up for in college, I knew little about the subject. But easy money is hard to come by for a freelance writer, and this job sounded like a cakewalk, so I set to work contacting professors at various reputable universities and asking them to rank their top ten philosophers. To my surprise, there was no disagreement about who deserved the top two slots on the list. Every professor I phoned or e-mailed named the ancient Greek philosopher Plato number one, followed by his prot�g� Aristotle.</p><p>I knew a thing or two about Aristotle, since he&#x2019;d been one of the final entries in the lone Aa&#x2013;Ar volume of a children&#x2019;s encyclopedia that my mother had purchased at the supermarket one Saturday to keep me quiet while she shopped. (I wrote many grade school papers on the differences between aardvarks and anteaters.) Aristotle&#x2019;s genius is still evident to a modern reader, and his work is very much in line with what most of us assume philosophy is. He talks a lot about ethics and logic. He was a master of classification who sorted messy subjects like language and nature into neat categories that we still use today. He&#x2019;s a little dull, but &#x201c;invented deductive reasoning&#x201d; is a pretty impressive accomplishment for anyone to list on his resume.</p><p>Aristotle&#x2019;s teacher, Plato, was in many ways his opposite. Where Aristotle&#x2019;s work is dry and rational like a science textbook, Plato&#x2019;s philosophy is entertaining and figurative. His writings unfold as dialogues between characters, some drawn from real life. It&#x2019;s not always clear if he&#x2019;s being serious or ironic. Yet Plato&#x2019;s influence has been so great that the eminent British logician Alfred North Whitehead once commented&#x2014;in a remark that I must&#x2019;ve heard a dozen times during my reporting&#x2014;that Western philosophy &#x201c;consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&#x201d;</p><p>What had seemed like a quickie writing assignment stretched into weeks of research as I struggled to get a grip on Plato&#x2019;s engrossing but slippery ideas. One afternoon, while reading Julia Annas&#x2019;s introductory survey <i>Plato</i>, I came across a sentence so striking that I had to reread it twice before its significance sank in: &#x201c;In terms of sheer numbers of people affected, probably the most influential thing Plato ever wrote was his unfinished story of Atlantis.&#x201d; In other words, the most impactful concept ever put forth by the most celebrated philosopher of all time was the famous tale of a lost civilization that sank beneath the waves.</p><p>That the story of Atlantis&#x2014;much beloved by psychics, UFO spotters, and conspiracy theorists&#x2014;should have sprung from one of history&#x2019;s greatest minds struck me, to put it lightly, as a little odd. It was like hearing that Wittgenstein had helped fake the moon landings.</p><p>Around this time the Ocean extension of Google Earth was launched. The Atlantis seekers almost immediately flooded the Internet with claims that they&#x2019;d<i> </i>located it at the bottom of the Atlantic near the Canary Islands. But what had initially looked like the street plan of a vast underwater metropolis turned out to be a grid pattern caused by ships&#x2019; sonars. After a few days the excitement faded. I assumed the seekers turned their attention back to more important matters, like searching for Bigfoot.</p><p>I did not yet understand that Atlantis is a virus, and that I&#x2019;d been exposed.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Starting in the late 1970s, a hugely successful movie trilogy was released that changed the lives of a generation of American boys. These three tales of incredible journeys, inspired by ancient myths and conflicts that transpired a long time ago in places far, far away, were cinematic catnip for preadolescent suburban youths with overactive imaginations and limited athletic skills. Some of my fondest childhood memories are of being dropped off with my best friend at the local Lake Theater and vibrating in our seats with anticipation. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the dialogue was hackneyed or that we knew good would triumph over evil in the end. Even today, reading the titles of those three film epics gives me a chill that Luke Skywalker&#x2019;s adventures never could: <i>In Search of Noah&#x2019;s Ark</i>,<i> Beyond and Back</i>, and <i>In Search of Historic Jesus</i>.</p><p>What made these movies, and their beloved stepsibling, the Leonard Nimoy&#x2013;hosted television show <i>In Search Of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,</i> so enticing was their willingness to explore what were known then as &#x201c;unexplained phenomena&#x201d; by straddling the worlds of history and myth. My Catholic school education didn&#x2019;t allow for a lot of gray areas and ambiguities. Rather than declaring everything to be either true or false, these movies and programs left things open-ended. (<i>Could this thing that looks like a dirty tablecloth actually be the burial shroud of Jesus? Probably not&#x2014;but maybe!</i>) A lot of what I watched was simply goofy&#x2014;even at age ten I had doubts about anything involving Martians or communicating with plants. But usually, by the time the credits rolled I felt an uncontrollable urge to solve some mystery of my own. With enough hours in the library and one of those cool archaeologist&#x2019;s brushes, why couldn&#x2019;t I find Noah&#x2019;s ark or figure out the meaning of Stonehenge?</p><p>I should have known I had no natural immunity against a contagion as powerful as Atlantis, but the symptoms crept up on me slowly. Just as a couple who&#x2019;s thinking about having a baby suddenly starts seeing pregnant women on every street corner, I began to notice mentions of Atlantis online or on TV. The popular notion that Atlantis had sunk in the middle of the Atlantic seemed to have fallen out of fashion. I watched a BBC documentary that argued the Greek island of Santorini had been the original Atlantis, then saw a Discovery Channel special that strongly suggested the lost city had once been located in Antarctica. Months passed. Another writing assignment took me to a banquet for people who&#x2019;d achieved incredible medical results through alternative health therapies. As a conversation starter I mentioned my new interest to my tablemates and nearly started a fistfight between a homeopath and an aromatherapist. One knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that Atlantis had been in the Bahamas while the other angrily insisted that only an idiot would search anywhere but the Mediterranean.</p><p>The more I became intrigued, the more apparent it became that searching&#x2014;<i>actively</i> searching&#x2014;for Atlantis, a discipline sometimes referred to as Atlantology, is something of a growth industry. Using clues embedded in Plato&#x2019;s dialogues, Atlantologists had variously &#x201c;located&#x201d; his lost island empire in Scandinavia, Alaska, Indonesia, and just about every country that touches a large body of water. A few arguments were even made for landlocked, mountainous countries such as Bolivia, which seemed a little ambitious considering that whole sank-into-the-sea aspect. According to the most thorough tally I could find, more serious hypotheses about the location of Plato&#x2019;s lost civilization had been proposed in the last ten years than in the previous twenty-four hundred, going all the way back to the days when Plato walked the streets of Athens.</p><p>Virtually all these possible sites had been found by energetic amateur sleuths. Serious historians and archaeologists, when they deigned to consider Atlantis at all, have always tended to treat Plato&#x2019;s tale as a fiction invented to illustrate his complex political philosophy. At least the polite ones did. One specialist in archaeology and ancient history had written an entire book that treated the urge to find Atlantis as a sort of mental disorder.</p><p>And yet, almost universally believers and nonbelievers both agreed that Plato had done two things that made a real Atlantis seem believable. First, he embedded dozens of precise details in his story, including measurements, landmarks, and its position relative to other known places&#x2014;the same sorts of particulars that have been used to find other lost cities. Second, Plato claimed repeatedly that the story was true and had been passed down to him from very reputable historical sources. This assurance only raised more questions. Was his pledge of veracity a clever philosopher&#x2019;s trick to make a fantastic tale sound more realistic, or did he really believe that Atlantis had once existed? Was it possible that Plato believed the story but had been given false information? No original manuscripts of Plato&#x2019;s works exist. Could his writing have been corrupted with errors over the centuries through the process of being transcribed by hand, over and over?

There's only one problem: the line of would-be Zia assassins is longer than he could have possibly known.</p><p>Amazon Best of the Month, May 2008: On August 17, 1988, Pak One, the airplane carrying Pakistani dictator General Zia and several top generals, crashed, killing all on board --and despite continued investigation, a smoking gun--mechanical or conspiratorial--has yet to be found. Mohammed Hanif's outrageous debut novel, <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i>, tracks at least two (and as many as a half-dozen) assassination vectors to their convergence in the plane crash, incorporating elements as diverse as venom-tipped sabers, poison gas, the curses of a scorned First Lady, and a crow impaired by an overindulgence of ripe mangoes. The book has been aptly compared to <i>Catch-22</i> for its hilarious (though not quite as madcap) skewering of the Pakistani military and intelligence infrastructure, but it also can trace its lineage to Don DeLillo, doing for Pakistan what <i>Libra</i> did for JFK conspiracy theory, and Kafka's <i>The Trial</i>, with its paranoid-but-true take on pathological bureaucracy. Recent events pushing Pakistan into the worst kind of headlines make <i>A Case of Exploding Mangoes</i> a timely and entertaining read, and when a mysterious bearded man called "OBL" makes an appearance at a Fourth of July party for U.S. military brass, we're coolly reminded of the fickleness of opportunistic policy in unpredictable lands. --<i>Jon Foro</i> <br><br> <b>Mohammed Hanif on his experience in the Pakistan Air Force Academy</b> <p></p>Once upon a time, when I was eighteen, I found myself locked up in Pakistan Air Force Academy's cell along with my friend and partner-in-crime, Khalid Saifullah. We had thought we were doing charity work but the Academy officers obviously didn't share our ideals. We had been caught trying to help another classmate pass his chemistry exam, something he had failed to do twice already and this was his last chance to save himself from being expelled. The logistics of our rescue effort involved a wireless set improvised in the Sunday Hobbies Club, a microphone concealed in a crap bandage around the left elbow of our academically challenged friend, and a Sanyo FM radio receiver. We were running our operation from the roof top of a building next to the examination hall. We were caught red-handed whispering reversible chemical equation into the transistor. <p></p> We were in breach of every single standard operating procedure in the Academy rule book, and faced certain expulsion. We had just started our glorious careers and now we faced the prospect of being sent home and having to explain to our parents how, instead of training to become gentlemen-officers, we were running an exam-cheating-mafia from the rooftop of the most well-disciplined training institute in the country. <p></p> For two days, while we waited in that cell to find out about our fate, we planned our future. Khalid, always the world-wise in this outfit, immediately decided that he was going to join the merchant navy and travel the world. I tried hard to think what I would do. I came from a farming family where even the most adventurous members of our clan had only managed to branch out into planting sugarcane instead of potatoes. Education, jobs, careers were absolutely alien concepts. The Academy was supposed to be my escape from a lifetime that revolved around wildly fluctuating potato crop cycles. And here I was, already a prisoner of sorts, facing a journey back to a life I thought I had left behind. <p></p> "Maybe I&#x2019;ll become a teacher," I said vaguely. The farmers in my village used to show some vague respect to teachers in the primary school I attended. "Or a mechanic." I was a member of the car-maintenance club in the hobbies club after all. It was considered an elite club since there was no car to maintain. It was basically a hobbies club for people who hated hobbies. <p></p> "You can&#x2019;t even change a bloody tire," Khalid reminded me. <p></p> We managed to stave off the impending expulsion through a combination of confession and denial: we lied (we were listening to cricket commentary on the transistor radio), we grovelled (we were ashamed, ashamed, ashamed of our unofficer like behaviour) and we pleaded our undying passion for defending the borders of our motherland. They looked at our relatively clean record, our sterling academic achievements and let us off the hook and awarded us a punishment considered just short of expulsion. We were barred from entering the Academy&#x2019;s TV room--and from walking. For forty-one days. During the punishment period, we had to stay in uniform from dawn till dusk and when ever we were required to go from point a to b we had to run. Khalid went on to become a fairly good marathon runner (before, years later, dying in an air crash, while trying to pull a spectacular but impossible manoeuvre in Mirage fighter plane). I discovered Academy's library. I had barely noticed that the college had a very well-stocked library. We knew it was there, we occasionally used it as a quiet corner to hatch conspiracies but I had never noticed that the long rambling hall was lined with cupboards full of books. All the cupboards were locked, but you could see pristine untouchable books behind their glass doors. The librarian, an eagle-nosed old civilian, walked around with a large bunch of jangling keys although his wares were not in any danger of being stolen. I was to find out later that he was quite a professional. The library was immaculately catalogued. You could of course go to him, fill out a form and request a book. But I never actually saw anybody fill out a form. I spent some afternoons staring at the books from behind the glass doors as my classmates watched videos in the TV room (including the fellow who had scraped through his chemistry exam and survived but would die years later in our current president's General Pervez Musharraf&#x2019;s moronic military adventure in Kargil on India-Pakistan border). <p></p> How do you ask for a book when you are eighteen and have been brought up in a household where the only book was the Quran and the only reading material an occasional old newspaper left behind by a visitor from the city? "I want that book," I asked the librarian pointing tentatively towards a cupboard which contained a thick volume of something called <i>The Great Escapes</i>. The librarian, relieved at having found a customer, took out his bunch of keys, removed a key and asked me to go get it myself. I took my time and browsed for a long time before filling out the form and borrowing the book. So grateful was I for getting that book that I brought him a samosa and cup of tea next day. That turned out to be a very good investment as the librarian handed me the bunch of his keys as soon as I entered. I browsed randomly, recklessly, reading first paragraphs and author bios, and made na�ve judgments. <i>The Cross of Iron</i> wasn&#x2019;t a religious thriller but a war novel. <i>Crime and Punishment</i> had very little crime in it. Was Rushdie related to the famous pop singer Ahmed Rushdie? Mario Puzo and Mario Vargas Llosa. The strange covers of Borges. Abdullah Hussain, I had heard of. A whole shelf devoted to Gabriel Garcia Marquez. <i>Chronicle</i>. Was that little book about the wrecked ship really a true story? I didn&#x2019;t know which one was a thriller and which one was literary. <i>As I Lay Dying</i>--sounds like a nice title so let&#x2019;s read it. So does <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>. It is probably not the right way to read. Discovering books was like a discovering a second adolescence. I discovered new sensations in my body. It was even better. It was guilt-free and I could show off. Not that anyone except my librarian friend was impressed. <p></p> Outside the library, the world revolved around parade square, hockey fields and series of punishments and rewards that didn&#x2019;t seem very different from each other. The vocabulary used to run the Academy life comprised of about fifty words, half of which were variations on the word 'balls.' Every order began or ended with balls, it was used as verb, adjective, qualifier or just simply a howl. Balls to you. Balls to mother, my balls, I'll cut your balls.... Every order, every threat, every compliment was a variation on the same testicular theme. Now that I look back at, it is quite obvious that this place was drowning in its own testosterone. <p></p> From outside, life could seem orderly. Uniforms were starched, rifles were oiled and sessions on the parade square hard and long. I yearned for that jangling of the keys in the library corridors. Once I was caught in my Navigation class reading <i>Notes from the Underground</i> hidden under a map that I was supposed to be studying. After our second year in the Academy, there were sudden attempts to turn us into good Muslims. Compulsory prayers. Quran lectures. Islamic Studies classes. In the third year we were caught stealing oranges from a neighbourhood orchard and as a punishment we were sent out to a mosque outside the Academy where Muslim cousins of Jehovah's Witnesses taught us how to knock on random doors and preach Islam. <p></p> "But they are all Muslims," I had protested. <p></p> "So are you," came the reply. "And look at yourself." <p></p> At that time I didn&#x2019;t realise that we were an experiment in Islamisation of the whole society. General Zia was a distant presence. He was our commander-in-chief and the permanent president of Pakistan. He thought he was never going to die. So did we. <p></p> Years later, sitting in the officers' mess of a Karachi air base, we heard about the plane crash that killed him and several other generals. We were sad about the pilots and the crew of the plane. To drown our sorrows we pooled our meagre savings, ordered a bottle of Black Label whiskey, and instead of hiding in our bachelor quarters as we normally did, we opened the bottle in the officers' mess TV room and discussed our future. I left the air force a month later. <p></p> <i>--Mohammed Hanif</i>Mohammed Hanif runs the Urdu service of the BBC's World Service.

Before, I&#x2019;d only ever been ghosts and fat ladies, both of which were easy: all you needed was a sheet and a lot of talcum powder, or a dress and a hat and some padding. But this year would be the last one I&#x2019;d ever be able to disguise myself, or so I believed. I was getting too old for it &#x2014; I was almost finished with being thirteen &#x2014; and so I felt the urge to make a special effort.<br> &nbsp;<br> Halloween was my best holiday. Why did I like it so much? Perhaps because I could take time off from being myself, or from the impersonation of myself I was finding it increasingly expedient, but also increasingly burdensome, to perform in public.<br> &nbsp;<br> I got the Headless Horseman idea from a story we&#x2019;d read in school. In the story, the Headless Horseman was a grisly legend and also a joke, and that was the effect I was aiming for. I thought everyone would be familiar with this figure: if I&#x2019;d studied a thing in school I assumed it was general knowledge. I hadn&#x2019;t yet discovered that I lived in a sort of transparent balloon, drifting over the world without making much contact with it, and that the people I knew appeared to me at a different angle from the one at which they appeared to themselves; and that the reverse was also true. I was smaller to others, up there in my balloon, than I was to myself. I was also blurrier.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had an image of how the Headless Horseman was supposed to look. He was said to ride around at night with nothing on top of his shoulders but a neck, his head held in one arm, the eyes fixing the horrified viewer in a ghastly glare. I made the head out of papier m�ch�, using strips of newspaper soaked in a flour-and-water paste I cooked myself, as per the instructions in <i>The Rainy Day Book of Hobbies</i>. Earlier in my life &#x2014; long ago, at least two years ago &#x2014; I&#x2019;d had a wistful desire to make all the things suggested in this book: animals twisted out of pipe cleaners, balsa-wood boats that would whiz around when you dropped cooking oil into a hole in the middle, and a tractor thing put together out of an empty thread spool, two matchsticks, and a rubber band; but somehow I could never find the right materials in our house. Cooking up paste glue was simple, however: all you needed was flour and water. Then you simmered and stirred until the paste was translucent. The lumps didn&#x2019;t matter, you could squeeze them out later. The glue got quite hard when it was dry, and I realized the next morning that I should have filled the pot with water after using it. My mother always said, &#x201c;A good cook does her own dishes.&#x201d; But then, I reflected, glue was not real cooking.<br> &nbsp;<br> The head came out too square. I squashed it at the top to make it more like a head, then left it down by the furnace to dry. The drying took longer than I&#x2019;d planned, and during the process the nose shrank and the head began to smell funny. I could see that I should have spent more time on the chin, but it was too late to add on to it. When the head was dry enough, at least on the outside, I painted it what I hoped was a flesh colour &#x2014; a wishy-washy bathrobe pink &#x2014; and then I painted two very white eyeballs with black pupils. The eyes came out a little crossed, but it couldn&#x2019;t be helped: I didn&#x2019;t want to make the eyeballs grey by fooling around with the black pupils on the damp white paint. I added dark circles under the eyes, and black eyebrows, and black enamel hair that appeared to have been slicked down with brilliantine. I painted a red mouth, with a trickle of shiny enamel blood coming down from one corner. I&#x2019;d taken care to put a neck stub on the bottom of the head, and I painted this red &#x2014; for where the head had been severed &#x2014; with a white circle in the middle of the bottom part, for the neck bone.<br> &nbsp;<br> The body of the Horseman took some thought. I made a cape out of a piece of black fabric left over from a now-obsolete puppet stage of mine, gathering it at the neck end &#x2014; designed to sit on top of my head &#x2014; and sewing buttons down the front, and cutting two inconspicuous holes at eye level so I&#x2019;d be able to see out. I borrowed my mother&#x2019;s jodhpurs and riding boots, left over from before she was married &#x2014; she hadn&#x2019;t ridden a horse since her wedding day, she was in the habit of saying, proudly or regretfully. Probably it was both. But I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to my mother&#x2019;s tone of voice, then: I had to tune it out in order to charge full speed ahead with what I myself was doing.<br> &nbsp;<br> The riding boots were too big, but I made up for that with hockey socks. I safety-pinned the jodhpurs around the waist to keep them from falling down. I got hold of some black winter gloves, and improvised a horse whip out of a stick and a piece of leather I&#x2019;d scrounged from the box of archery materials. Archery had once been popular with my father, and then with my brother; but my father had given it up, and the box had been abandoned in the trunk room in the cellar, now that my brother had to study so much.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried on the entire outfit in front of my mirror, with the head held in the crook of my arm. I could scarcely see myself through the eyeholes, but the dark shape looming in the glass, with two sinister eyeballs staring out balefully from somewhere near the elbow, looked pretty good to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the night itself I groped my way out the door and joined my best friend of the moment, whose name was Annie. Annie had done herself up as Raggedy Ann, complete with a wig of red wool braids. We&#x2019;d taken flashlights, but Annie had to hold my arm to guide me through the darker patches of the night, which were numerous in the badly lit suburb we were traversing. I should have made the eyeholes bigger.<br> &nbsp;<br> We went from door to door, shouting, &#x201c;Shell out! Shell out!&#x201d; and collecting popcorn balls and candy apples and licorice twists, and the Halloween toffees wrapped in orange and black waxed paper with designs of pumpkins and bats on them of which I was especially fond. I loved the sensation of prowling abroad in the darkness &#x2014; of being unseen, unknown, potentially terrifying, though all the time retaining, underneath, my own harmless, mundane, and dutiful self.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a full moon, I think; there ought to have been one. The air was crisp; there were fallen leaves; jack-o-lanterns burned on the porches, giving off the exciting odour of singed pumpkin. Everything was as I&#x2019;d imagined it beforehand, though already I felt it slipping away from me. I was too old, that was the problem. Halloween was for little children. I&#x2019;d grown beyond it, I was looking down on it from my balloon. Now that I&#x2019;d arrived at the moment I&#x2019;d planned for, I couldn&#x2019;t remember why I&#x2019;d gone to all that trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was disappointed, too, at the response of the adults who answered the doors. Everyone knew who my friend Annie was portraying &#x2014; &#x201c;Raggedy Annie!&#x201d; they cried with delight, they even got the pun &#x2014; but to me they said, &#x201c;And who are you supposed to be?&#x201d; My cape had a muffling effect, so I often had to repeat the answer twice. &#x201c;The Headless Horseman.&#x201d; &#x201c;The headless what?&#x201d; Then, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that you&#x2019;re holding?&#x201d; they would go on to say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the head. Of the Headless Horseman.&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh yes, I see.&#x201d; The head would then be admired, though in the overdone way adults had of admiring a thing when they secretly thought it was inept and laughable. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me that if I&#x2019;d wanted my costume to be understood immediately I should have chosen something more obvious.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, there was one member of the audience who&#x2019;d been suitably impressed. It was my little sister, who hadn&#x2019;t yet gone to bed when I&#x2019;d made my way through the living room en route to the door. She&#x2019;d taken one look at the shambling black torso and the big boots and the shiny-haired, frowning, bodiless head, and had begun to scream. She&#x2019;d screamed and screamed, and hadn&#x2019;t been reassured when I&#x2019;d lifted up the cape to show that it was really only me underneath. If anything, that had made it worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Do you remember the head?&#x201d; I ask my sister. We&#x2019;re in her rackety car, driving over to see our mother, who is now very old, and bedridden, and blind.<br> &nbsp;<br> My sister doesn&#x2019;t ask, &#x201c;What head?&#x201d; She knows what head. &#x201c;It looked like a pimp,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;With that greaser hair.&#x201d; Then she says, &#x201c;Smart move, Fred.&#x201d; She talks out loud to other, inferior drivers when she&#x2019;s driving, a thing she does adroitly. All of the other drivers are named Fred, even the women.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do you know what a pimp looks like?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A dead pimp, then,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not completely dead. The eyes followed you around the room like those 3-D Jesuses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t have. They were sort of crossed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They did, though. I was afraid of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You played with it, later,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;When you were older. You used to make it talk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was afraid of it anyway,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, Fred, take the whole road.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Maybe I warped you in childhood,&#x201d; I say.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something did,&#x201d; she says, and laughs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a while after that Halloween, the head lived in the trunk room, which contained not only two steamer trunks filled with things of my mother&#x2019;s from her previous life &#x2014; tea cloths she&#x2019;d embroidered for her trousseau, long kid gloves she&#x2019;d saved &#x2014; but also a number of empty suitcases, and the metal box of fly-tying equipment, and the archery materials, and an assortment of miscellaneous items I used to rummage through and pilfer. The head was on an upper shelf, the one with the battered skates and the leather boots &#x2014; my father&#x2019;s, also my mother&#x2019;s. Foot, foot, foot, foot, head, foot, foot, foot &#x2014; if you weren&#x2019;t ready for this arrangement and happened to glance up at it, the effect could be disconcerting.<br> &nbsp;<br> By that time we had a second phone in the house so I could talk with my boyfriends, or go through what passed for talking, without exasperating my father too much &#x2014; he thought phone conversations should be short, and should convey information. The door to the trunk room was right beside the phone. I liked to keep that door closed while I was talking; otherwise I could see the head staring out at me through the gloom, blood dribbling from the corner of its mouth.With its sleek black hair and minimal chin, it looked like a comic-book head waiter who&#x2019;d got into a fight. At the same time it seemed malignantly attentive, as if it was taking in every word I said and putting a sour construction on my motives.<br> &nbsp;<br> After its period of retreat in the trunk room, the head migrated into my sister&#x2019;s dress-up box. By now, I was fifteen and my sister was four. She was still an anxious child &#x2014; if anything, she was more anxious than ever. She didn&#x2019;t sleep through the night &#x2014; she&#x2019;d wake up five or six or seven or nine or ten or eleven times, according to my mother. Although I had the room right next to hers, I never heard her plaintive calls and frightened wailing. I slept through it all as if drugged.<br> &nbsp;<br> But sleeping mothers hear the cries of their own children, we&#x2019;ve been told. They can&#x2019;t help it. Studies have been done. My mother was no exception: she&#x2019;d hear the little voice calling to her across the blankness of sleep, she&#x2019;d half wake, then stumble into my sister&#x2019;s room, soothe her mechanically, bring her drinks of water, tuck her in again, then go back to bed and fall asleep, only to be wakened once more and then once more and then once more. She&#x2019;d grown thinner and thinner in the last four years, her skin pale, her hair brittle and greying, her eyes unnaturally large.<br> &nbsp;<br> In actuality, she&#x2019;d caught a disease of the thyroid from the hamster we&#x2019;d foisted on my sister as a pet in the vain hope that the sound of it creaking round and around on its exercise wheel at night would be calming to her. It was this disease that accounted for my mother&#x2019;s scrawniness and staring eyes: once diagnosed, it was easily cured. But that detail tended to get sidelined during the later recountings of this story, both by my mother and by me. The fairy child, the changeling who didn&#x2019;t follow the convenient patterns of other children, who sucked up its mother&#x2019;s energy in an uncanny and nocturnal manner &#x2014; this is a theme with more inherent interest to it than a hamster-transmitted thyroid disease.<br> &nbsp;<br> My sister did look a little like a fairy changeling. She was tiny, with blond braids and big blue eyes, and a rabbity way of nibbling on her lower lip as if to keep it from trembling. Her approach to life was tentative. New foods made her nervous, new people, new experiences: she stood at the edge of them, extended a finger, touched gingerly, then more often than not turned away. No was a word she learned early. At children&#x2019;s parties she was reluctant to join in the games; birthday cake made her throw up. She was particularly apprehensive about doors, and about who might come through them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus it was probably a bad idea of my father&#x2019;s to pretend to be a bear, a game that had been a great success with his two older children. My sister was fascinated by this game as well, but her interest took a different form. She didn&#x2019;t understand that the bear game was supposed to be fun &#x2014; that it was an excuse for laughing, shrieking, and running away. Instead, she wanted to observe the bear without being spotted by it herself. This was the reason she&#x2019;d snipped two holes at eye level in my mother&#x2019;s floor-to-ceiling drapes. She&#x2019;d go in behind the drapes and peek out through the holes, waiting in a state of paralyzed terror for my father to come home. Would he be a bear, or would he be a father? And even if he looked like a father, would he turn into a bear without warning? She could never be sure.<br></p><h2>Magic, Its Ritual, Power and Purpose</h2><p>The aim of the genuine magician, says W.E. Butler, is to realise that True Self of which his earthly personality is but the mask. In this book is to be found a remarkably concise explanation of the ancient uses, ritual and true aims of Magic. the author sweeps away the confusion caused by the many misconceptions, and surveys the history of Magic from the &#39;old religion&#39; of pre-Christian times through to the discoveries of modern psychology. and it is, he says, with the modern school of psychology, particularly Jungian, that the magician finds his closest link with modern thought. Since the author is writing for Western man he is not concerned with Eastern magical systems, but here explains the &#39;Western Tradition&#39; of Magic. This tradition embodies the teaching and practices that have been handed down from antiquity, the central philosophy on which it hinges being the corpus of Hebrew mystical wisdom known as the Qabalah. Magic, far from being an irrational superstition, is based upon profound psychological laws, and possesses its own special technique. Although repressed throughout the ages in the Western world, it has never ceased to exist and has from time to time emerged in different forms - one of the most notable in Britain being the &#39;Order of the Golden Dawn&#39;, which is still in existence, and perpetuates Western magical traditions. This book constitutes a most useful preliminary guide to any study &#39;in depth&#39; of this admittedly vast subject.</p><p></p><h2>A Vision for Preaching: Understanding the Heart of Pastoral Ministry</h2><p>This book by a well-respected teacher of preachers develops an integrated biblical and theological vision for preaching that addresses the essentials of this most important activity in the church. Drawing on influential voices from church history, Abraham Kuruvilla reclaims what has been lost through the centuries and offers fresh insights, showing preachers what they can aim for as an ideal in their preaching. He helps preachers have a better conception of what it means to preach, a fuller understanding of the divinely granted privilege of preaching, and a greater excitement for the preaching ministry. Concluding biblical reflections reinforce the teaching of each chapter.</p><p>"Kuruvilla offers a systematic and readable vision for the preparation of sermons and especially the preparation of preachers as they wrestle with the biblical text. Rightly arguing that the key to authoritative preaching is grasping the originally intended theological meanings of biblical texts, the author challenges us to take the Scriptures seriously and to read the Bible forward rather than backward."<br>--<b>Daniel Block</b>, Wheaton College; author of <i>For the Glory of God</i><br><br>"Kuruvilla is one of the best homiletical thinkers today.&nbsp;In this book he argues that preachers must discern a biblical author's theological intent in order to make valid and specific applications that will help conform listeners to Christ and bring glory to God.&nbsp;Kuruvilla has given us a vision for preaching that is insightful, comprehensive, and compelling."<br>--<b>Donald R. Sunukjian</b>, Talbot School of Theology<br><br>"Homiletics scholar Abraham Kuruvilla offers a compelling vision of what preaching is and can be, unpacking that vision through a series of chapters that explore what it means to be a biblical preacher. As he analyzes preaching through various lenses, he offers those who proclaim God's Word a useful and encouraging vision through which to interpret their own calling and task."<br>--<b>Michael Duduit</b>, executive editor, <i>Preaching</i> magazine; College of Christian Studies and Clamp Divinity School, Anderson University<br><br>"Kuruvilla sees the big picture. His vision is broad enough to embrace a spectrum of preaching objectives while remaining focused on the inspired words of Scripture. No book presents a better balance of heart and head, spirit and truth, and orthodoxy and orthopraxy than <i>A Vision for Preaching</i>."<br>--<b>Hershael W. York</b>, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br><br>"It is common for pastors to articulate vision statements for their churches, but it might also be helpful for pastors to describe a vision for their preaching. Kuruvilla, a leading homiletician, has thought through how he sees the task. <i>A Vision for Preaching</i>&nbsp;is well researched, thoughtful, and sometimes controversial, but fully worth consideration."<br>--<b>Kenton C. Anderson</b>, ACTS Seminaries of Trinity Western University and Northwest Baptist Seminary<br><br>"Kuruvilla provides a compelling vision that challenges preachers to lift their sights higher in the preaching task--a challenge worth considering!"<br>--<b>Scott M.

But that cannot last. Thorgrim, in a wolf dream, has seen the enemy armies closing in, and he knows that their peace will soon be at an end. The gods do not go so easy on him and his men. He has learned that through experience and hard use. Nor are the gods the only threat they face. As Nothwulf, brother of the murdered ealdorman of Dorset, and Cynewise, his sister-in-law, fight for rule of the shire, each seeks to make the raiders unwitting pawns in their game, maneuvering toward a final battle that each hopes will spell the end of the other and crush the Norse strangers who have invaded their shores.</p><p></p><h2>Old Records Never Die: One Man&#39;s Quest for His Vinyl and His Past</h2><p><b>A Hudson Booksellers Best Non-Fiction Book of the Year, with foreword&nbsp;by Wilco's Jeff Tweedy</b><br><br><i><b>High Fidelity&nbsp;</b></i><b>meets&nbsp;<i>Killing Yourself to Live</i>&nbsp;when one man searches for his lost record collection.<br><br></b>As he finds himself within spitting distance of middle-age, journalist Eric Spitznagel feels acutely the loss of... something. Freedom? Maybe. Coolness? Could be. The records he sold in a financial pinch? Definitely. To find out for sure, he sets out on a quest to find&nbsp;the original vinyl artifacts from his past. Not just copies. The exact same records: The&nbsp;Bon&nbsp;Jovi&nbsp;record with his first girlfriend's phone number scrawled on the front sleeve. The&nbsp;<i>KISS Alive II&nbsp;</i>he once shared with his little brother. The Replacements&nbsp;<i>Let It Be&nbsp;</i>he&#x2019;s pretty sure, 20 years later, would still smell like weed.<br><br> As he embarks on his hero's journey, he reminisces about the actual records, the music, and the people he listened to it with&#x2014;old girlfriends, his high school pals, and, most poignantly, his father and his young son. He explores the magic of music and memory as he interweaves his adventures in record-culture with questions about our connection to our past, the possibility of ever recapturing it, and whether we would want to if we could.<br><br>"Memories are far more indelible when married to the physical world, and Spitznagel proves the point in this vivid book. We love vinyl records because they combine the tactile, the visual, the seeable effects of age and care and carelessness.

But ice cream isn&#x2019;t something you stay up late thinking about. You don&#x2019;t argue about ice cream&#x2019;s deeper meanings with your friends. You don&#x2019;t obsess over ice cream because you feel like ice cream understands you in ways you didn&#x2019;t think it was possible to be understood. Nobody says, &#x201c;This is the ice cream I want eaten at my funeral.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m talking about the kind of music that sinks into your pores, that enters your bloodstream and becomes part of your DNA. It&#x2019;s the song that stuck by you when you felt abandoned or misunderstood, and you&#x2019;re pretty convinced it was written specifically for you. When you hear people say &#x201c;I love that song too,&#x201d; you just smirk. What do they know of love? Their relationship with the song is a one-night stand&#x2014;a summer fling at best&#x2014;but you and this song, you&#x2019;re soul mates.</p><p>When people challenge you with that hypothetical poser &#x201c;If you could bring only one album to a desert island, what would it be?,&#x201d; you always mention a certain record, because it&#x2019;s got that song you&#x2019;re pretty sure you could spend the rest of your earthly time listening to it on a constant loop, as you collected firewood and hunted for animals with crudely made spears and went slowly insane. That song, that particular arrangement of notes and words, would be all the comfort you needed as you died alone on a beach. But you don&#x2019;t say that. You pretend it&#x2019;s a difficult question, and it&#x2019;s the first time you&#x2019;re considering it, and you&#x2019;re like, &#x201c;Hmm, let me think about that.&#x201d; You try to be all cool and casual about it, pretending that your feelings about the song aren&#x2019;t a little bit inappropriate, and hearing it doesn&#x2019;t automatically make you feel less alone in the universe, and if it didn&#x2019;t exist, something about you would be different somehow.</p><p>Think about that song right now. Close your eyes and let those familiar chords drift through your head.</p><p>Is it there? Can you hear it? </p><p>What does it smell like?</p><p>Now, for some of you, what I just asked will make no sense. You think I&#x2019;m talking gibberish. And that&#x2019;s okay. You&#x2019;re from a genera- tion that knows about music only as a digital thing. It isn&#x2019;t something that can be touched or held. It&#x2019;s not a physical thing. It&#x2019;s in the ether. It&#x2019;s on a screen and needs to be bitstream compliant. It&#x2019;s all about megabytes and gigabytes and compression algorithms. It has to be downloaded or streamed or kept in a cloud.</p><p>Not so long ago, there were two audio formats: &#x201c;That sounds good&#x201d; and &#x201c;Nope, sounds like an Alvin and the Chipmunks record.&#x201d; That was all you needed to know. Now, when you get new music, you have to ask, &#x201c;Am I going to need a LAME MP3 encoder to hear this?&#x201d; Or &#x201c;Does it have enough kilobits? Just 128? I accept nothing less than 640!&#x201d;</p><p>MP3s, or M4As or WMAs or AIFFs or OGGs, whatever your digital format of choice, doesn&#x2019;t smell like anything. The device that plays your music&#x2014;your iPod or laptop or whatever&#x2014;that may smell like something. But it&#x2019;ll smell like that same thing whether you&#x2019;re listening to Foo Fighters or Jay Z. It&#x2019;s not unique to a particular song or album.</p><p>Records are something different. They&#x2019;re physical objects. Big, bulky, inconvenient, easily damaged objects. Vinyl is like skin that changes, in good and bad ways, over a lifetime. Skin gets damaged, intentionally or by accident&#x2014;maybe it gets burned, or tattooed, or scarred&#x2014;but it always retains some of its original character. It&#x2019;s the same skin&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just weathered some life.</p><p>Some of these records&#x2014;the good ones, anyway&#x2014;have a distinct smell. They might smell like the beach. Or your dad&#x2019;s cologne. Or when you bought Elton John&#x2019;s Greatest Hits for two dollars in 1977 at a Lions Club&#x2019;s garage sale in a recently renovated building that used to be a cherry processing plant, and even a decade after the fact, the record smells like cherries.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s another one. Billy Joel&#x2019;s The Stranger. I can&#x2019;t even look at the album cover without smelling Calvin Klein&#x2019;s Obsession.</p><p>During the mideighties, my grandmother was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer. My parents flew out to New York for the surgery, and my brother and I were sent to stay with family friends. The family that took me in had a daughter, Debbie, who was about two years older than me, and almost unfairly attractive. A woman who looked like her in a Whitesnake video was one thing, but existing in the world, walking past you in the school hallway, a reminder of how your fantasies can be right in front of you but also a million miles away, was just not cool.</p><p>I remember being dropped off at her house and her parents taking me to her room, saying, &#x201c;This is where you&#x2019;ll be sleeping.&#x201d; And I sat there, in her room, totally mesmerized. Because Jesus Christ, I was in her bedroom. The place where she slept, maybe in her under- wear.</p><p>I went immediately to her records, because I just had to know&#x2014; what does a beautiful women listen to while sitting around her room in sexy underwear? The first record I pulled out was Billy Joel&#x2019;s The Stranger. I&#x2019;d never heard of it before, but the cover was amazing. Joel is sitting on a bed, wearing a full suit and no shoes, gazing down at a white theater mask next to him, with a pair of boxing gloves on the wall. Cringingly pretentious, but for a thirteen-year-old boy who still owned all of his original Star Wars action figures, Billy Joel seemed super complex and deep.</p><p>I made a mental note to wear more suits and buy some boxing gloves.</p><p>The record had its own unmistakable scent. I wasn&#x2019;t able to put a name to it until decades later, when I was on a blind date and the girl was wearing Obsession. While we were making out, I took a deep breath of her neck and said, &#x201c;You smell like Billy Joel&#x2019;s The Stranger.&#x201d; (It didn&#x2019;t end well.)</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure how long I was sitting there, smelling Debbie&#x2019;s The<br>Stranger, when the door burst open and Debbie came charging in. </p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said, beaming. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; I said, staring at her like she was a black bear that&#x2019;d just wandered into my campsite.</p><p>She nodded, inching closer to me. &#x201c;This is going to be so cool,&#x201d;<br>she said.</p><p>I had no idea what she meant by that. I remember thinking, &#x201c;Cool how? What&#x2019;s so cool about it? And why&#x2019;s she standing so close to me? Is she waiting for me to do something? Maybe kiss her? Oh Jesus, should I kiss her? Of course I should kiss her! There couldn&#x2019;t be a more obvious signal. I&#x2019;m totally going to kiss her.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t kiss her. And I never really talked to her again during the entire week I was at her house. It&#x2019;s possible I missed my opportunity. It&#x2019;s even more possible that she&#x2019;d confused me with another boy and was too polite to say anything when she got close enough to realize it.</p><p>I eventually bought my own copy of The Stranger. But it wasn&#x2019;t the same. The songs sounded generally similar, but something fundamental was missing. It didn&#x2019;t have that hot-girl smell.</p><p>There&#x2019;s another record whose unmistakable odor has become a sort of personal mythology for me. The Replacements&#x2019; Let It Be, first released in 1984, first purchased by me in 1986, and my copy eventu- ally sold in 1999. For the vast majority of its existence, the record sleeve was used for more than just a protective envelope for the vinyl. It also served as a sort of safe-deposit box for my stash of marijuana.</p><p>It&#x2019;s amazing I ever thought I was getting away with anything. I think my thought process was, if somebody&#x2014;my parents, DEA agents doing random searches of teenage bedrooms&#x2014;got the crazy idea that kids were hiding marijuana in record sleeves, they&#x2019;d look at titles a little more obvious. They&#x2019;d probably check my Cypress Hill. Or my Grateful Dead. Or my Bob Marley Legend, which I kept in my closet in clear sight specifically as a weed red herring. It&#x2019;d never cross their minds to looks elsewhere. They&#x2019;d be, &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t bother looking for his stash in any of those &#x2019;Mats records. They were into heavy drinking, not weed.&#x201d; Because obviously, both the DEA and my mother would have done extensive research on the intoxicants of choice of my favorite artists.</p><p>I was never busted, and not because Let It Be was such a clever disguise. Obviously nobody cared that I was smoking marijuana.<br>I haven&#x2019;t stopped listening to those songs. I&#x2019;ve owned the album on several formats. I&#x2019;ve had three CDs of Let It Be, and numerous MP3s of the songs, which I&#x2019;ve synced to too many iPods, iPads, nanos, minis, and shuffles. The notes are the same, the voice sounds familiar, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel like my music anymore. For one thing, the smell is gone. And the scratches, well, there aren&#x2019;t any scratches. Which isn&#x2019;t something you&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d miss. But I miss those scratches more than anything.<br>The scratches matter. They&#x2019;re not just an imperfection. Some- thing meaningful happens when those scratches are made. Some- thing is etched into the grooves. Something important has become a part of your permanent record. And the song is your witness. It&#x2019;s borne witness to your milestones; it held your proverbial hand when life got shitty, or gave you a danceable beat when there was something to celebrate. The song, yes, but more significantly, the physical object that was with you, that you touched and held on to and watched spin around and around as you listened to it make the music that felt like it might be the only thing keeping you alive. It wasn&#x2019;t just the messenger. It was your companion. It was an accomplice.</p><p>If you saw it again&#x2014;that record, that specific record&#x2014;would you recognize it?</p><p>Would you know it was yours?</p><p>If it was one of my records, I&#x2019;d like to think I&#x2019;d recognize it. Even if it&#x2019;s been sitting in a damp basement, or stored under a leaky air conditioner. I know where all the scratches are; I put them there myself. I know every pop and hiss. I&#x2019;d recognize my records like I&#x2019;d recognize my own flesh and blood.</p><p>During the first few months after my dad died in 1999, I had this recurring fantasy that he&#x2019;d faked a heart attack. Maybe he did it so he could skip town to evade back taxes, or run away with his mistress. Whatever it was, the story was comforting. It was my life raft during his funeral: the thing that kept my head above water so I didn&#x2019;t suffocate on grief. I imagined him somewhere in New Orleans, with a bad dye job and a mustache, living a gypsy lifestyle as he moves from motel to motel with his Brazilian lover.</p><p>Sometimes, when I&#x2019;m daydreaming, I have this vision of myself wandering through a Mardi Gras parade, and I see him in the distance, with a handlebar mustache and a safari hat, sucking back the last of his hurricane before kissing the neck of . . . what&#x2019;s her name? Rosario? Yolanda? And then our eyes meet, and I know that he knows that I know it&#x2019;s him, and he smiles at me in that weak way that says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, son. I&#x2019;m sorry that I wasn&#x2019;t there for you over these past fifteen years, and I&#x2019;m sorry that I missed so much of your life. I love you more than you can begin to imagine, and I wish I didn&#x2019;t have to leave, but la vida es corta! You&#x2019;ll understand someday.&#x201d;</p><p>And then poof, he&#x2019;s gone, disappeared into the crowd. I chase after him, pushing people out of the way, stumbling over revelers in masks and slipping through guys on stilts and knocking drinks out of the hands of tourists and running and running and running, the sound of joyous laughter and music and celebration all around me. I know I&#x2019;m never going to find him, but somehow it&#x2019;s okay, just knowing he&#x2019;s still out there, and he&#x2019;s still breathing the same humid air that I am, and at least now he realizes that he never fooled me, with his silly &#x201c;he had a heart attack at sixty&#x201d; ruse.</p><p>Just like I&#x2019;d recognize my father&#x2019;s eyes in a Mardi Gras parade, I&#x2019;d recognize my copy of the Replacements&#x2019; Let It Be. The one that was with me through puberty and too many girlfriends and years of stomach-clenching loneliness and an ego that sometimes felt like it was held together with Scotch tape and sloppy punk riffs. If I saw it again, I&#x2019;d know it was mine. And not just because it smells like weed.</p><p>Of course I&#x2019;d recognize it. Assuming I was ever in the same room with it again, it&#x2019;d be impossible for me not to recognize it. But that&#x2019;s not the hard part. The hard part would be finding it, since I sold the record when I was still in my twenties. A lot has happened in my life since I let it go. I got married, and had my first meaningful employment, and buried my father, and almost got divorced, and became a parent. It would be laughably impossible, but maybe. If you looked long enough, and hard enough, and refused to give up, maybe you do find it again. Maybe you find your dead dad in the Mardi Gras parade. The thing you thought was lost forever, that part of yourself that just disappeared, that vanished when you weren&#x2019;t paying attention, maybe you chased it down and kept running until you cornered it in a back alley and you managed to get it back.</p><p>But then what?</p></p><h2>Rurouni Kenshin, Vol. 21</h2><p>Though he once killed in the name of the nascent Meiji government, even an infamous manslayer such as &#34;Hitokiri Batt�sai&#34; might grow weary and vow never to kill again. As a new age dawns, there are those who yet cling to the ways of bloodshed, and see the days of peace and prosperity Kenshin and others like him fought so hard to bring forth as betrayal. In ten days&#39; time, the enemies of Kenshin will come for him, and all who stand beside him are in danger. Is the time of earthly justice truly at hand?</p><p>He won an honourable mention prize in the Shonen Jump. &#34;New Manga Hop Step Award&#34; with the work Podomakku.

Pierre, sketchbook in hand, is drawn to the enigmatic powers of the mountain and its springs, and attempts to uncover the truth behind them in the secret rooms he discovers deep within the complex.

The Swedish film<i> </i>won top honors at sixteen film festivals around the globe. Stephen King called the American remake, titled <i>Let Me In, </i>"A genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last twenty years."The Border <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Even when the man first appeared in the doorway, Tina knew he had something to hide. With each step that he took toward the customs desk she became more sure. When he selected the green lane Nothing to Declare and walked right by her, she said, &#x201c;Excuse me, would you mind stopping a moment?&#x201d; and glanced at Robert to make sure he was with her. Robert nodded curtly. People who were about to be caught could take desperate measures in order to escape. Especially if they were smuggling anything that could land them in jail. And that was the case with this man. Tina was sure of it. <br>&#x201c;Would you please put your bag here?&#x201d; <br>The man placed a small suitcase on the counter, unlocked it, and lifted the lid. He was accustomed to this, something his appearance testified to: an angular face, low forehead, small deeply set eyes under heavy brows. A beard and half-long hair. Could have played a Russian assassin in an action film. <br>Tina leaned across the counter and at the same time pressed the concealed alarm bell. Her senses told her with 100 percent certainty that the man was carrying something illegal. Maybe he was armed. In the corner of her eye she saw Leif and Andreas go stand in the doorway to the inner room, waiting. <br>The suitcase did not contain much. Some clothes. A driving map and a couple of Mankell bestsellers, a telescope, and a magnifying glass. A digital camera that Tina lifted up in order to examine it more closely, but her sense told her that it wasn&#x2019;t anything. <br>At the very bottom of the bag there was a large metal container with a lid. In the center of the lid there was a round counter with a needle. A cord was attached to the side of the container. <br>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Take a guess,&#x201d; the man said and raised his eyebrows as if he found the situation enormously funny. Tina met his gaze, which held a great calm. That could be due to two reasons: he was either crazy or he was sure she wouldn&#x2019;t find what he was hiding. <br>The third alternative&#x2014;that he didn&#x2019;t have anything to hide&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t even consider. She knew. <br>The only reason that she was working in Kapellsk�r was that it was located so close to her home. She could have worked wherever she liked. Customs offices across the country requested her services whenever a significant drug cache was expected. Sometimes she would go, stay for a few days in Malm� or Helsingborg until she had pointed out the smuggler. Often pointing out a cigarette or human smuggler while she was at it. Her sense was as good as 100 percent accurate. The only thing that could cause her to err was if an individual was carrying something that was not against the law but that the person in question was eager to conceal. <br>Inevitably sex toys of various kinds came to light that way. Dolls, vibrators, movies. In Gothenburg she stopped a man on the ferry from England whose bag had turned out to contain a great deal of science fiction: Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke. The man had looked around nervously, his bag wide open on the counter and when she spotted his clerical collar she had closed it and bid him a good day. <br>Three years ago she had been in the United States working the border in Tijuana. She had pointed out five people who were smuggling heroin&#x2014;two of them internally, packed in condoms&#x2014;before the cache they had been waiting for arrived. <br>Three eighteen-wheelers with hollow wheel drums. One thousand two hundred kilos. The largest seizure in ten years. She was rewarded with ten thousand in consultant fees and had been offered a position with a salary that was five times as high as the one she had in Sweden, but she had declined. Before she left, she had tipped them off to investigate two of their own employees. She was as good as sure that they had been bought off to secure the heroin transport. It turned out that she was right. <br>She could have become a multimillionaire by flitting around the globe and taking on such temporary assignments, but after the U.S. trip she had declined any further such activities. The two individuals she had identified had not only given off a strong nervousness but threat. For safety&#x2019;s sake she had stayed with the head customs official and driven in with him to work. It is dangerous to know too much, especially when so much money is at stake. <br>So she had settled in Kapellsk�r, which lay ten minutes from her farm in Gilleberga in R�dmans� island. The number of seizures had increased dramatically at the beginning of her tenure only to dip later, and gradually decrease. The smugglers simply knew that she worked there and that Kapellsk�r was to be considered a secured harbor. The past few years there had been mostly alcohol and the occasional unprofessional opportunists, their suitcase linings stuffed with anabolic steroids. <br>Her work schedule varied week to week so that the smugglers would not be able to predict which hours would be impossible and exploit the others. <br>Without touching the container she pointed to it and said, &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a game. What is this?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;An insect incubator.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; <br>The man smiled imperceptibly in his beard and picked it up. She now saw that the cord coming out of the side of it ended in a normal plug. He removed the lid. The interior was divided into four chambers, separated by thin walls. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s for hatching insects,&#x201d; he explained and held up the lid, displaying the meter in the center of it. &#x201c;A thermostat. You take electricity, heat&#x2014; <i>pouff</i>! You have insects.&#x201d; <br>Tina nodded. &#x201c;Why would one have something like this?&#x201d; <br>The man replaced the container and shrugged. &#x201c;Is it illegal?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m just wondering.&#x201d; <br>The man leaned across the counter and asked in a low voice, &#x201c;Do you like insects?&#x201d; <br>Something very unusual occurred. A cold shiver ran down along her spine and she assumed that she gave off the same nervousness that she was so good at detecting in others. Luckily there was no one here who could sense it. <br>She shook her head and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to come step in here for a while.&#x201d; She showed him to the inner room. &#x201c;You can leave your bag here.&#x201d; <br>They inspected his clothes and they inspected his shoes. They went through everything in his bag and then the bag itself. They found nothing. They could only do a body inspection if there was adequate motivation. <br>Tina asked the others to leave. When they were alone, she said, &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re hiding something. What is it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How can you be so sure?&#x201d; <br>After everything he had been through, Tina felt he deserved an honest answer. &#x201c;I can tell by your smell.&#x201d; <br>The man chuckled. <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You may think it is ridiculous,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;But I assure you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>The man interrupted. &#x201c;Not at all. It sounds completely plausible.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; <br>The man threw his arms out and then gestured toward his body. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve searched me as thoroughly as possible and there&#x2019;s nothing else you can do. Isn&#x2019;t that correct?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then I think I would like to move on.&#x201d; <br>If Tina had been able to decide, she would have kept him locked up, had him under surveillance. But there was nothing in the law to allow for this. And anyway&nbsp;&#x2026; there was only one alternative left. The inconceivable third alternative. That she had been wrong. <br>She followed him to the door and said what she had to say. <br>&#x201c;I apologize for the inconvenience.&#x201d; <br>The man stopped and turned to her. <br>&#x201c;We may meet again,&#x201d; he said and then did something so unexpected that she did not have time to react. He leaned over and gave her a light kiss on the cheek. His beard was rough, sticking her like soft needles the moment before his lips met her cheek. <br>She flinched and pushed him away. &#x201c;What the hell are you doing?&#x201d; <br>The man held up his hands apologetically to show he was finished and said, &#x201c; <i>Entschuldigung</i>. Good-bye,&#x201d; and left. He took his suitcase and disappeared into the arrival hall. <br>Tina stood staring after him. <br>She left work early that day, went home. <br>The dogs welcomed her with their usual furious barking. She yelled at them as they stood there inside the fence with their hair on end and teeth bared. She hated them. Had always hated dogs and of course the only man who had ever shown an interest in her was a dog breeder. <br>So. When she had first met Roland his dog ownership had been limited to a single stud male. A pitbull by the name of Diablo who had won a number of illegal fights and who Roland took five thousand for breeding with promising, purebred females. <br>With the help of Tina&#x2019;s farm and Tina&#x2019;s financial assistance he had been able to increase his stable to two stud males, five bitches, and five young dogs who were waiting to be sold. One of the bitches was a magnificent specimen and Roland often traveled with her to conventions and competitions where he made new business contacts and was unfaithful. <br>This happened on a regular basis and had become part of her routine. Tina didn&#x2019;t ask about it any longer. She could smell that he had been with another woman and did not blame him. He was company and she did not have the right to hope for anything better. <br>Even though her daily life felt like a prison, there are moments in every person&#x2019;s life when they realize where their walls are placed, where the limits of their freedom exist. And if there are doors, or opportunities for escape. Her high school graduation party had been such a moment. <br>After every one in her class had drunk themselves to the point of intoxication at the rented venue, they had driven down to a park in Norrt�lje to sit on the grass and finish the wine that was left. <br>Tina had always felt uncomfortable at parties that most often ended with people pairing up. Not so this time. This time it was the class, their last time together and she was one of the gang. <br>When the wine was gone and the private jokes had been told one last time, they lay outstretched on the grass and did not want to go home, did not want to split up. Tina was so drunk that what she at that point thought of as her &#x201c;sixth sense&#x201d; was no longer working. She was simply one of the group lying there refusing to grow up. <br>It was extremely pleasant and it frightened her. That alcohol was a kind of solution. If she drank enough she lost that which separated her from the others. Maybe there was even medication that could block it, stopping her knowing those things she shouldn&#x2019;t know. <br>These were the kind of thoughts she was having when Jerry came crawling up to her. Earlier that evening, he had written inside her cap: &#x201c;Will never forget you. Your Jerry.&#x201d; <br>They had worked on the school paper together, written several things that had circulated in the school, been quoted by other students. They shared the same dark sense of humor, the same joy in writing meanly about those teachers who deserved it. <br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d; He lay down next to her and rested his head in his hand. <br>&#x201c;Well, hi.&#x201d; Her gaze was on the verge of seeing double. The pimples in Jerry&#x2019;s face blurred, were erased and in the half darkness he looked almost handsome. <br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What a good time we&#x2019;ve had.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c; <i>Mmm</i>.&#x201d; <br>Jerry nodded slowly. His eyes were shiny, unfocused behind his glasses. He sighed and pulled himself up into sitting with his legs folded. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something&nbsp;&#x2026; that I&#x2019;ve wanted to say to you.&#x201d; <br>Tina rested her hands on her stomach and looked up at the stars that shot their needles through the leaves. <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s just you know&#x2026;&#x201d; Jerry pulled a hand across his face and tried to minimize the slurring of his speech. &#x201c;That I like you. You know that.&#x201d; <br>Tina waited. What she had taken for an urge to urinate turned out to be more of a tingle. A warm nerve that trembled in a hitherto unused area. <br>Jerry shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to&nbsp;&#x2026; But it&#x2019;s like this. I&#x2019;m going to tell you how it is because I want you to know it now that we&nbsp;&#x2026; when maybe we won&#x2019;t be seeing each other again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s like this. That you&#x2019;re such a damned great girl. And I wish that&nbsp;&#x2026; and I&#x2019;m going to tell you what I&#x2019;m going to say&nbsp;&#x2026; I wish that I could meet someone just like you but who doesn&#x2019;t look like you.&#x201d; <br>The spot stopped vibrating. Grew, became cold. She didn&#x2019;t want to hear it, but still she asked, &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Just that&#x2026;&#x201d; Jerry hit his hand into the grass. &#x201c;Shit, you know what I mean. You&#x2019;re such a&nbsp;&#x2026; you&#x2019;re such a damned great girl and fun to be around. I&nbsp;&#x2026; yeah what the hell: I love you. I do. I said it. But that&#x2026;&#x201d; He patted the grass but more helplessly now. <br>Tina helped him finish. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m too ugly to be with.&#x201d; <br>He reached out for her hand. &#x201c;Come on. Don&#x2019;t be&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>She got up. Her legs were steadier than she had expected. She looked down at Jerry who was still sitting with his hand outstretched, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not. Go look at yourself in the mirror, for fuck&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; <br>She walked away with long strides. It was only when she was sure she was out of view and that Jerry wasn&#x2019;t following her that she let herself fall into a bush. The branches scratched her in the face, her bare arms, and finally held her. She bunched up her body, pressed her hands into her face. <br>What hurt the most was that he had wanted to be nice. That he had said the nicest thing that someone could say to her. <br>She stayed in the prickly cocoon and cried until she couldn&#x2019;t cry anymore. No doors. No way out. Her body wasn&#x2019;t even her prison, more like a cage where she could neither sit nor stand nor lie down. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The years had not made things better. She had learned to endure the life in the cage, accept her limitations. But she refused to look at herself in the mirror. The revulsion she saw in peoples&#x2019; eyes when they met her for the first time was mirror enough. <br>When all chance of hope was gone for the people she caught it sometimes happened that they yelled things at her. Something about the way she looked. Something about mercy killings, mongoloid. It was something she never got used to. That&#x2019;s why she let everyone else do the heavy lifting once she had identified a smuggler. To avoid the phase when illusions were gone and the mask fell away. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>An older woman was sitting on the porch of the little cottage reading a book. A bicycle was parked next to the railing. The woman lowered the book as Tina passed and continued to stare after her just a little too long after they had nodded to each other. <br>The summer had begun. The woman&#x2019;s gaze burned into her back as she walked into the big house and found Roland sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop. He glanced up as she entered. &#x201c;Hi. The first guest has arrived.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes. I saw that.&#x201d; <br>He turned his attention back to the computer. Tina looked in the guest register and found out that the woman&#x2019;s name was Lillemor and had a home address in Stockholm. Most of their guests were either from Stockholm or Helsinki. Occasionally they were Germans on their way to Finland. <br>It had been Roland&#x2019;s idea to rent out the cottage after he had heard how well the hostel a couple of kilometers down the street was doing. That had been at the start of their relationship and Tina had accepted it since she wanted him to feel that he had a part in making decisions at the farm. The kennel came half a year later. <br>&#x201c;You know what,&#x201d; Roland said. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll head off to Sk�vde this weekend. Think it might work there.&#x201d; <br>Tina nodded. The pitbull bitch Tara had been Best in Class twice but still lacked the Best in Show that would really put Roland&#x2019;s kennel on the map. It was an obses...</p><h2>Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios (Latin America Otherwise)</h2><p><i>Telling to Live</i> embodies the vision that compelled Latina feminists to engage their differences and find common ground. Its contributors reflect varied class, religious, ethnic, racial, linguistic, sexual, and national backgrounds. Yet in one way or another they are all professional producers of <i>testimonios</i>&#x2014;or life stories&#x2014;whether as poets, oral historians, literary scholars, ethnographers, or psychologists. Through coalitional politics, these women have forged feminist political stances about generating knowledge through experience. Reclaiming <i>testimonio</i> as a tool for understanding the complexities of Latina identity, they compare how each made the journey to become credentialed creative thinkers and writers. <i>Telling to Live</i> unleashes the clarifying power of sharing these stories.<br> The complex and rich tapestry of narratives that comprises this book introduces us to an intergenerational group of Latina women who negotiate their place in U.S. society at the cusp of the twenty-first century. These are the stories of women who struggled to reach the echelons of higher education, often against great odds, and constructed relationships of sustenance and creativity along the way. The stories, poetry, memoirs, and reflections of this diverse group of Puerto Rican, Chicana, Native American, Mexican, Cuban, Dominican, Sephardic, mixed-heritage, and Central American women provide new perspectives on feminist theorizing, perspectives located in the borderlands of Latino cultures.<br> This often heart wrenching, sometimes playful, yet always insightful collection will interest those who wish to understand the challenges U.S. society poses for women of complex cultural heritages who strive to carve out their own spaces in the ivory tower.<p></p><p><i>Contributors.</i> Luz del Alba Acevedo, Norma Alarc�n, Celia Alvarez, Ruth Behar, Rina Benmayor, Norma E.

Jews who settled here as peddlers in the nineteenth century joined a bilingual and progressive city that became the launching pad for the revolution that toppled the Spanish Empire in Cuba. As dozens of local Jews collaborated with Jos� Mart�'s rebels, they built relationships that supported thriving Jewish communities in Key West and Havana at the turn of the twentieth century. During the 1920s, when anti-immigration hysteria swept the United States, Key West's Jews resisted the immigration quotas and established "the southernmost terminal of the Jewish underground," smuggling Jewish aliens in small boats across the Florida Straits to safety in Key West. But these and other Jewish exploits were kept secret as Ku Klux Klan leaders infiltrated local law enforcement and government. Many Jews left Key West during the 1930s and their stories were ignored or forgotten by the mythmakers that reinvented Key West as a tourist mecca.<br> <br> Arlo Haskell's <i>The Jews of Key West</i> is is an entertaining and authoritative account of Key West's Jewish community from 1823-1969. Illustrated with over 100 images, it brings to life a history that had long been forgotten.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>The Jews of Key West: Smugglers, Cigar Makers, and Revolutionaries (1823-1969)</i></b><br><br>"Think you know Key West?

He attended the University of Michigan, where he won the prestigious Hopwood Award for writing, and now lives in Cottekill, New York, with his wife and their two children.1<br> You kill one person, it changes you.<br><br> You kill five&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s not about changing anymore.<br><br> It&#x2019;s who you are.<br><br> Quintero knew this. He&#x2019;d seen it in other men. Had seen it in himself. He saw it now as he watched Nick Mason prepare, remembering the day he picked him up at the gates of the federal prison in Terre Haute.<br><br> Remembering Mason&#x2019;s first job, in the motel room. The look on his face afterward&#x2014;blank, bloodless&#x2014;when he brought the Mustang to the chop shop.<br><br> When he said he&#x2019;d never do it again.<br><br> Until the next phone call.<br><br> That was the unwritten contract Nick Mason had signed. Twenty years of his life back in exchange for his service to Darius Cole. On call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. To do whatever was asked of him.<br><br> No matter what it was.<br><br> Mason stripped off his shirt to reveal the lean, hard muscles of a welterweight and pale white skin with no tattoos.<br><br> Even after five and a half years inside, he had come out without one drop of jailhouse ink on his body. Cole had made sure of it. Mason strapped on the soft armor tactical vest, thick enough to stop anything up to a&nbsp;.44 Magnum, then he pulled on the black turtleneck over that. With the black pants, the black rubber-soled shoes, it was the uniform of a professional. He took the black balaclava, formed it into a skullcap, and put it on over his close-cut hair. He pulled down the mask, adjusted it across his eyes, took one look in the mirror. Satisfied, he rolled it back up.<br><br> Quintero took the black canvas bag from his shoulder and put it down on the table. Mason unzipped the bag and looked inside.<br><br> &#x201c;Everything you&#x2019;ll need is in there,&#x201d; Quintero said. &#x201c;You have to remember, these are high-end guys. Top shape, know how to use their firearms.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How many of them?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Between ten and twelve,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not enough to stop you.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason shook his head as he tried on the scuba gloves.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the most important thing I told you?&#x201d; Quintero asked.<br><br> &#x201c;Stay off the twenty-first floor,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;At exactly ten o&#x2019;clock, it&#x2019;s going to blow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Once that happens, you&#x2019;ll be able to walk right out of there.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;Tell me the plan again,&#x201d; Quintero said. &#x201c;Step by step.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The delivery truck,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;It enters the parking garage at exactly nine thirty-five p.m.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br> Nick Mason watched the truck turn into the parking garage from Columbus Drive. It stopped at the large metal door while the driver waited for the man at the window to slide the door open. This gave Mason twenty seconds to climb under the truck, grab on to the exhaust system brackets, and lift his body&#x2019;s weight from the concrete, the canvas bag looped tight to his back.<br> The scuba gloves were thin and flexible, giving him a good grip and protecting every surface, even the underside of this truck, from fingerprints.<br><br> The truck rolled a hundred yards until it came to a stop, and the door slid shut behind it. When the truck was turned off, Mason lowered himself to the ground and stayed there, the canvas bag next to him.<br><br> It was 9:37 p.m., most of the business offices on the ground floor closed, the dinner rush at the restaurants over. Mason waited for the driver to get out of the truck, then followed a dozen yards behind him. He was inside the building.<br><br> The Aqua. Eighty-two stories high, one of the most distinctive buildings in downtown Chicago, on the north side of the Loop, with undulating balconies that wrap around the building on all four sides like rippling water. Inside, the theme continues through all of the decorations, from the blue-and-green color scheme to the saltwater fish tank in the lobby.<br><br> Mason moved quickly, without rushing, knowing exactly where to find the freight elevator. The target was on the forty-third floor, so he hit the button for 42, then used the fireman&#x2019;s override to take him all the way to his floor without stopping.<br><br> When he got to the forty-second floor, Mason stepped out of the elevator into the empty hallway. He spotted a room service tray on the floor outside one of the rooms, picked that up, and emptied it of all of the items except for the silver plate cover. Then he went to the stairwell at the end of the hallway and took the stairs up to forty-three.<br><br> Mason cracked open the stairwell door and scanned the hallway. The marshal was sitting in a chair outside the door, seven or eight doors down. Young, maybe thirty. Stocky. He looked more bored than vigilant. Mason opened up his canvas bag, took out the Mossberg 500 shotgun. Pistol grip model, with the shorter barrel. Six shell capacity. It was loaded with what the manufacturer artfully called a crowd control munition, silicone plugs that they said would cause &#x201c;nonlethal but incapacitative trauma&#x201d; upon impact.<br><br> Incapacitative trauma.<br><br> In other words, it would only make you wish you were dead.<br><br> &#x201c;You need to get over this,&#x201d; Quintero said to him. &#x201c;Killing one man and leaving everybody else alive.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason didn&#x2019;t answer. He loaded the plugs into the shotgun.<br><br> &#x201c;That gun in your hands, you think it cares who&#x2019;s on the other end?&#x201d;<br><br> Mason looked up at him.<br><br> &#x201c;You gotta be the same way,&#x201d; Quintero said. &#x201c;Before this bullshit gets you killed.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason took the H&amp;K USP semiautomatic from the bag and put it in his belt. The cartridge held fifteen nine-millimeter rounds, with a sixteenth already chambered. Finally, he took out the stun baton and hooked it to his belt. Eighteen inches long, three pounds of reinforced aluminum, with a &#x201c;police force level&#x201d; rating of twelve million volts that would shut down a man&#x2019;s entire neuromuscular system. One more piece of insurance.<br><br> Mason dropped the empty canvas bag to the floor, put a pair of low-profile plugs into his ears, then took one final moment to breathe, to focus on what was about to happen, because once it started it would all flow quickly, one movement after another, without a single beat of hesitation.<br> He opened the stairwell door and moved down the hallway. The room service tray hid the semiautomatic in his belt&#x2014;positioned at eleven o&#x2019;clock for a right-handed cross draw&#x2014;and also hid the baton and most of the shotgun.<br><br> The marshal stood up and said, &#x201c;Hey! You can&#x2019;t be here!&#x201d;<br><br> That moment of indecision as the marshal reached for his radio. Mason dropped the tray and leveled the shotgun at the man&#x2019;s chest, had just enough time to see the young man&#x2019;s eyes go wide as he pulled the trigger and sent the silicone plug into his abdomen, just below the tactical vest.<br><br> The marshal went down, curled up in a ball. He wouldn&#x2019;t be getting back up, not without a lot of help and some pain medication. Mason pulled the balaclava down over his face as he approached him. The man looked even younger up close&#x2014;a kid who had no business being stationed here alone. Mason reached into the man&#x2019;s jacket and removed the Glock from his holster, along with his radio. Then he took out the pen from his own pocket&#x2014;the tip had been replaced by a DC adapter and the barrel contained a circuit board that would read the 32-bit hotel code and repeat it back to the card reader in less than a second.<br><br> He knew the clock was ticking now. Somebody had heard that shot, was already calling down to the front desk.<br><br> &#x201c;The marshal inside the room is the leader of the team. He&#x2019;s an iron man. Eight hours straight, he doesn&#x2019;t leave his client&#x2019;s side. Not to sleep, not to eat, not to use the fucking bathroom&#x2014;unless he actually drags the man in there with him.<br><br> &#x201c;He takes this shit personally, and he can shoot. They got one of his target sheets hanging up at the range. So don&#x2019;t fuck around.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason plugged the pen into the charging port on the bottom of the door&#x2019;s locking mechanism and the light flashed green. He pushed the door, ready to kick it all the way open when it caught against the security latch, but the door swung free.<br><br> Mason stepped inside, staying close to the wall. He didn&#x2019;t see any movement in the room. The only light was the nighttime ambient glow coming from the window. He took a few more steps into the room, his right finger on the shotgun trigger. As he looked into the small kitchen, then the bedroom and the bathroom, the truth became obvious:<br><br> There was nobody here.<br><br> No marshal. No target.<br><br> The room was a decoy.<br><br> &#x201c;How do we know the accountant will be there? If he&#x2019;s in WITSEC&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We have a marshal on the inside. McLaren has been moved up to Chicago for a pretrial deposition.&#x201d;<br><br> Ken McLaren, once Darius Cole&#x2019;s chief accountant. A former IRS agent, a genius at moving money overseas, &#x201c;redomiciling it&#x201d; by investing in businesses that all looked legal on paper, then bringing the money back, avoiding any taxes.<br><br> For almost a decade, he made Cole a shitload of money.<br><br> Then McLaren&#x2019;s son got picked up on the University of Chicago campus with a dealer-weight bag of ecstasy pills, and they held that over McLaren&#x2019;s head until he agreed to testify against Cole.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re setting up for the retrial,&#x201d; Mason said.<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to worry about that. All you need to worry about is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I know. I hit him, then I leave.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think about the second thing until you&#x2019;ve done the first.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason went back out to the hallway and grabbed the marshal, still curled up in a fetal position and holding his abdomen. He cried out in pain as Mason dragged him into the room and closed the door.<br><br> &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br> The marshal didn&#x2019;t respond. Mason put the barrel of the shotgun against the man&#x2019;s temple.<br> &#x201c;Strike one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; the marshal said.<br><br> Mason moved the barrel from the man&#x2019;s temple to his leg, pulled the trigger, and sent the silicone plug at sonic speed into the thigh muscle. The man recoiled from the shock of it, and then a half second later the trauma arranged itself into one coherent message to his brain and he started screaming.<br><br> Mason gave the man a few seconds to wear himself out. Then he put the barrel back to the man&#x2019;s temple.<br><br> &#x201c;Strike two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Up,&#x201d; the man said, sputtering and trying to catch his breath.<br><br> &#x201c;Up where?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ten floors. Fifty-three.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which room?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason put the barrel against the man&#x2019;s temple again.<br><br> &#x201c;5307.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason took the handcuffs from the man&#x2019;s belt, hooked one to the man&#x2019;s right wrist, and dragged him a few feet over to the bar top, where there was an old-fashioned brass footrail near floor level. He hooked the free cuff to the rail, then he took the phone off the bar and threw it in the kitchen sink. As he bent down to take the man&#x2019;s cell phone, he put his mouth close to his ear.<br> &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s not there, I&#x2019;ll make you wish I had killed you.&#x201d;<br><br> Mason picked up the room service tray on his way out, went back to the stairwell, and climbed ten floors to fifty-three. He cracked open the hallway door.<br><br> The hallway was empty.<br><br> No man out front, one more way to keep the room a secret.<br><br> Mason moved quickly down to 5307, took out the pen, and keyed the lock. He was surprised once again when the door didn&#x2019;t catch on the latch, barely had time to process how the marshal had set him up for this, when the door behind him swung open.<br><br> &#x201c;Freeze!&#x201d;<br><br> Mason turned just in time to face the gun blast and feel the impact against his chest, the bullet halted by the vest but the force spreading out through his body like he&#x2019;d been hit by a sack of cement. He pulled the trigger of the shotgun as he fell backward, but the shot was high. The marshal was already stepping forward, lining up for his second shot, when Mason fired again. This time, he hit the man in the groin and he went down, landing on Mason&#x2019;s legs.<br><br> Mason pushed the man off him. This man was older, with graying hair and a worn face&#x2014;had probably been a marshal for thirty years at least. Sworn to protect his clients with his life. He clutched at his groin with both hands, his eyes closed tight, sucking in air with rapid breaths through clenched teeth. Mason took the man&#x2019;s Glock and his radio and then dragged him into the apartment across the hall.<br><br> The place was barely furnished. Couch, television, coffee table, lots of empty space and nowhere to hide. He went into the kitchen. Then the bedroom, looked under the bed, in the empty closet. He went into the bathroom and slid open the shower curtain.<br><br> Where the hell is McLaren?<br><br> Mason came back into the main room, stood there for a moment, remembered where he was, what made the Aqua the Aqua: the balconies on every floor, all the way to the top. He went to the curtain and pulled it open.<br><br> The accountant was outside, pressing up against the far corner of the iron railing. He wasn&#x2019;t the man Mason had expected&#x2014;not a pencil-pushing scarecrow but a man who obviously spent time at the gym, even if the biceps that strained against his dress shirt were purely for show. Mason slid the door open, felt the cold rush of air against his face. He could hear the traffic on Columbus, fifty-three stories below. A siren wailed in the distance, probably already on the way to this building, while a million lights from the city glittered all around them. Under any other circumstances, it would have been a beautiful place to be.<br><br> The accountant stood up straight and looked him in the eye as Mason took the semiautomatic from his belt.<br><br> The time for nonlethal force was over.<br><br> As Mason raised the semiautomatic, he saw something in McLaren&#x2019;s eyes, turned a beat too late, and felt the impact on his right forearm. The gun clattered to the balcony floor and was kicked away as Mason swung around to face the recovered marshal. I should have made sure he was out, the words ringing in his head even as he faced a bigger problem, as the marshal lined up Mason and hit him across the jaw. Mason came back up, swung his foot right into the man&#x2019;s groin, and put him down again.<br><br> He was reaching for the baton on his belt when the accountant tackled him from behind, the momentum carrying them back into the room. Mason, the accountant&#x2019;s arms still locked around him, landed flush on the coffee table and flattened it. Mason twisted around and grabbed for the man&#x2019;s neck, but the accountant had fifty pounds on him, and he started swinging wildly at Mason&#x2019;s head. He felt McLaren&#x2019;s wedding ring scrape one of his cheeks, felt another blow next to his eye, and then as the man tried to aim a fist into his ribs, he let out a cry of pain as his hand crumpled against the tactical vest. Mason, still clutching the metal baton, laid it against the side of the accountant&#x2019;s head.<br><br> Mason rolled them both over just in time to see the marshal pick up the shotgun from the floor. Mason grabbed it and twisted it away, breaking at least one of the marshal&#x2019;s fingers as the gun went off, feeling the heat through his gloves as the television screen exploded. Mason hit the button on his baton and jabbed it right into the man&#x2019;s neck, sending twelve million volts into this body. The marshal was frozen in place until Mason took the baton away and hit hi...</p><h2>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men&#39;s Health: Lessons from the Harvard Men&#39;s Health Studies (Well-Being Centre = Centre Du Mieux-Etre (Collection))</h2><p><i>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Heal</i>th assembles into a single volume a quarter-century's worth of hard-won knowledge about men's health -- knowledge that men need to lead longer, healthier lives. <br> More than twenty-five years ago, researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health began what have become the largest aggregate studies ever of men's health.

The result is The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health: <br> � Features the most current information on the health-preserving functions of diet, exercise, and over-the-counter drugs and supplements<br> � Gives straight answers to questions like when drinking alcohol is beneficial and when it's not<br> � Offers advice on behavior modification and stress control � Includes all the crucial information on diseases that are particularly important to men, including prostate cancer, testicular cancer, erectile dysfunction, and kidney and bladder problems<br> � Provides an easy-to-navigate guide to the health-care system that gives balanced views on the benefits and drawbacks of common medical tests <br> With the authority that only the world's largest and best-known medical school can provide, and the lively, clear presentation that is the hallmark of <i>Harvard Men's Health Watch,</i> the monthly newsletter edited by Dr. Simon, <i>The Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health</i> is an essential reference for every man -- and for everyone who cares about a man's health.</p><p><p> <b>Harvey B. Simon, M.D.,</b> is a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and a founding member of the Harvard Cardiovascular Health Center. An associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a member of the Health, Sciences, and Technology faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Simon is the founding editor of the <i>Harvard Men's Health Watch</i> newsletter and the author of four books on health and fitness for general readers as well as more than 100 scientific articles and medical textbook chapters.</p><b>Chapter Six: The Answers: Aspirin and Other Supplements</b><p>"If only there were a pill."</p><p>Every man would like an easy way to stay healthy. Good nutrition and regular exercise are the keys for preventing illness, but diets take discipline and exercise takes time. Is there a shortcut? Can a few pills do the trick? Can "all-natural" supplements replace the physical activity and healthful eating that should be part of human nature?</p><p>If you look for the answer on the Internet or listen for it on TV or radio, you are likely to come away with a resounding "yes." That's mostly because vitamins, herbs, and other supplements are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. Congress took care of that in 1994, when it passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. As a result, the supplement industry can tout its products without having to substantiate their claims for efficacy and safety. With billions of dollars at stake, the hype is relentless. In all, more than 50 percent of all Americans take supplements, spending upwards of $4 billion a year to buy health in a bottle.</p><p>Most doctors have been skeptical of supplements, pointing out correctly that anecdotes and testimonials can never be relied on in place of sound scientific studies. In the past few years, though, good studies have started to appear. While few herbs have been scrutinized, research by the Physicians' Health Study, the Health Professionals Study, and other investigations suggests that some supplements may be helpful while others are wasteful or even harmful. Surprisingly, perhaps, one of the most promising of all is not a vitamin or an herb, but an inexpensive, old-fashioned, medicine chest standby: aspirin.</p><p><b>Aspirin</b></p><p>Its name is more than a century old, but its parent compound has been in use for thousands of years. The ancient Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks all used willow leaves to treat inflammation, fever, and pain. The practice was popularized in England by Reverend Edward Stone in 1763. The active ingredient was purified from willow bark in Germany sixty-five years later. At the tail end of the nineteenth century, scientists at the Bayer Company succeeded in producing the modern derivative, <i>acetylsalicylic acid,</i> or aspirin. The very same drug has been used for fever and pain ever since. In the past thirty years, it has gained new importance in the management of heart disease and stroke, and current studies suggest it may someday assume a role in preventing colon cancer and possibly even Alzheimer's disease. And just as aspirin is finding new uses, scientists are finding out exactly how it works. It is important research that is likely to result in a new generation of even better drugs. But even in the dawning era of "super-aspirins," the original drug is certain to retain much of its value.</p><p><b>How It Works</b></p><p>Aspirin does its job by inhibiting the body's production of <i>prostaglandins.</i> Although you may never have heard of them, prostaglandins have a wide-ranging impact on human health. For example, they keep the stomach lining healthy, they regulate blood flow to the kidneys, and they enable platelets to trigger blood clotting. But prostaglandins also contribute to disease; in the brain they cause fever, and in joints and other tissues they can produce inflammation and pain.</p><p>Aspirin is not the only drug that inhibits prostaglandins. In fact all the <i>nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</i> (NSAIDs) act in similar fashion (see Table 6.1, page 168). But although <i>acetaminophen</i> (Tylenol and other brands) fights fever and pain as well as aspirin, it does not inhibit prostaglandins. As a result, it does not share either the antiinflammatory benefits or the major side effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs.</p><p><b>Aspirin and Atherosclerosis</b></p><p>Aspirin does not prevent or even minimize atherosclerosis, but it can help prevent heart attacks and some strokes. It sounds like a paradox, but it is not. Aspirin cannot prevent cholesterol-laden plaques from building up in the wall of an artery, though it may be able to reduce the inflammation that perpetuates the damage (see Chapter Three and Figure 3.1). But while plaques narrow arteries, rarely do they produce the complete blockages that cause heart attacks. Instead, the culprit is a blood clot or <i>thrombus</i> that forms on the surface of a ruptured plaque. The clot completes the blockage, and aspirin exerts its protective effect by inhibiting clot formation.</p><p>Clots are triggered by platelets, fragmentary blood cells that are produced in the bone marrow, and then pour into the bloodstream. A man's blood contains a total of 100 million platelets, but because each platelet only lasts about ten days, the marrow must produce them continuously at a prodigious rate. Aspirin does not reduce the number of platelets in the blood, but it does inhibit their ability to trigger clots.</p><p>Platelets are extremely sensitive to aspirin. In some studies, doses as low as 10-30 milligrams can inhibit all the platelets in a man's body. Once platelets are inhibited by aspirin, they stay inhibited, but since new platelets are entering the blood continuously, the aspirin dose must be repeated every twenty-four to forty-eight hours to keep the majority of platelets under control.</p><p><b>Primary Prevention of Heart Attacks</b></p><p>You would probably call it staying healthy, but doctors call it primary prevention. By either name, it means heading off a problem before it makes its first appearance. Can aspirin prevent a first heart attack in men without diagnosed heart disease?</p><p>This is the question that the Physicians' Health Study set out to answer in 1982. A total of 22,071 male physicians volunteered to be subjects in a randomized clinical trial of low-dose aspirin. Half the men were assigned to take 325 milligrams of aspirin every other day, while the others each were given an identical-appearing placebo tablet every other day. To eliminate bias, the assignments were made randomly and neither the subjects nor the researchers knew which men were taking aspirin and which the placebo.</p><p>The researchers had planned to continue the trial until 1990, but it was terminated three years ahead of schedule. That was because an independent Data Monitoring Board that was tracking the results declared it would be unethical to continue the study since a clear winner was already evident. The winner was aspirin.</p><p>In the Physicians' Health Study, the men who took aspirin had a 44 percent reduction in the risk of suffering a heart attack. Benefit did not depend on a man's family history of heart disease or on his cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, body fat, amount of exercise, or his drinking or smoking habits. But one risk factor did predict benefit: age. Aspirin was highly effective in men older than fifty, but not in younger individuals.</p><p>The results of the Physicians' Health Study were published in the same year as the report of the British Doctors Trial, which found no benefit from aspirin. Does that mean men should take aspirin in America but not in Europe? Not at all. The British trial was much smaller than the U.S. study, involving just 5,139 men. It was also less carefully controlled. But the biggest difference was in the dose of aspirin; the British doctors took 500 milligrams every day, the Americans just 325 milligrams every other day.</p><p>When you have a headache or a fever, you are likely to take two 325 milligram aspirin tablets every four to six hours. Even the British doctors' dose is tiny in comparison, but it may still be too high to produce maximum protection against heart attacks. That is because tiny doses of aspirin will inhibit only <i>thromboxane A2,</i> the enzyme in platelets that triggers the clotting process, but higher doses can also inhibit <i>prostacyclin,</i> an enzyme in blood vessels that reduces clotting. In theory, at least, low doses of aspirin will reduce clot formation, but even slightly higher doses might lessen that benefit. Two 1998 studies found that 75 milligrams of aspirin a day can reduce the risk of a first heart attack by about one-third, and a 2001 investigation found that 100 milligrams a day reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 44 percent, but none of these reports investigated varying amounts of aspirin. However, a 1999 study from six European countries compared four aspirin doses and found that low amounts (81 or 325 milligrams a day) were actually better than higher doses (650 or 1,300 milligrams a day) in preventing strokes.</p><p>When it comes to aspirin for prevention, less is more.</p><p>Although the Physicians' Health Study demonstrated that low-dose aspirin could help prevent heart attacks in healthy men fifty or older, its 1989 report did not link aspirin use with a reduction in overall cardiovascular deaths. The aspirin trial was terminated early, and its five-year span may have been too short to discern an effect on mortality. But even after the randomized clinical trial was terminated, 11,010 of the subjects continued to take the drug on at least 180 days a year, while 3,849 took little or no aspirin. In 2000, the study reported that over a seven-year period, a low-dose aspirin was associated with a 35 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths and a 36 percent drop in total mortality.</p><p>The Physicians' Health Study trial has provided additional information about aspirin's effect on the heart. The drug seems most effective in the early morning hours, when platelets are particularly likely to stick together and produce clots. It is a good thing, since that is when heart attacks are most likely to occur. Aspirin begins working rapidly and it remains effective as long as it is being taken. That is because the very first dose will inhibit all the platelets in a man's blood, but the body does not build up resistance to the drug. Aspirin was effective in preventing heart attacks in men who had angina, but it did not prevent healthy men from developing angina. That's because angina is caused by plaques that produce partial blockages, but heart attacks are the result of clots that form on plaques.</p><p><b>Secondary Prevention ...</b></p></p><h2>This Way to the Sugar</h2><p>The poems in Hieu Minh Nguyen&#39;s debut collection are a fearless and brutal dissection of nostalgia, trauma, and desire.

If it's unclear&nbsp;how&nbsp;Nguyen survived the wreckage, at least we know why: beauty, Eros, the body.

For more about Lori, visit her Web site at www.lorifoster.com."Jesus, Quick. You're a freak of nature. You know that, right?"<br><br>Armie Jacobson, known as Quick to his fighter friends, ignored the complaint and threw a few more jabs, then a solid body shot, making Justice, a six-foot-five heavyweight, double over. Stepping back, Armie flexed his hands, bounced on the balls of his feet and waited.<br><br>Unfortunately, Justice only put his hands on his knees and sucked air.<br><br>Frowning, Armie removed his mouthpiece. "Seriously? Come on, dude. Let's go."<br><br>"Screw you." Schlepping back to his corner, Justice grabbed up a water bottle. He doused his head and chest and then started chugging.<br><br>Aware of others watching, Armie said nothing. Everyone worked out, trained and sparred in the rec center, but lately, whenever he did, a dozen or more people stopped to watch. He didn't mind an audience. Hell, he couldn't be a competitor if he did. For the most part he paid no attention. Once he got in the cage, he went into a zone and the world receded.<br><br>But this insane ogling shit, as if he was a damned sideshow, bugged him big-time.<br><br>A trickle of sweat tracked down his temple from his headgear, and he swiped a forearm over his face. His muscles burned and more sweat soaked his chest, abs and rolled down his spine. He was figuring out what to say to Justice to get him back in action when he picked up <em>her</em> scent. The faint perfume cut through the rec center air, thick with the smells of sweaty men working hard.<br><br>Trying to look casual, Armie stared at Justice but in his peripheral vision he saw her striding across the room. No mistaking that long-legged gait, or that longer dark hair. He swallowed, frozen.<br><br>"What?" Justice asked, sounding both suspicious and ridiculously alarmed with the way Armie had locked onto him.<br><br>Armie shook his head&#x2014;and thankfully Merissa disappeared into the hallway leading to the offices.<br><br>Releasing a breath, he looked toward the clock and frowned. Yeah, they'd been at it for a while, maybe longer than he'd intended. His cardio was better than most, definitely better than Justice's, the big lug.<br><br>Armie walked over to him. "You need to get more gas in the tank."<br><br>"Go fuck yourself."<br><br>When Armie grinned, Justice eyed him warily. "Stop it."<br><br>That switched his grin to a frown. "Bitchy much?"<br><br>Justice slouched against the wall and glared back. "You shouldn't be able to grin, you prick. You should be as tired as me."<br><br>A natural trainer, Armie took pity on him. "You're a lot bigger." As a six-foot-tall middleweight, Armie stood five inches shorter and weighed a lot less than Justice.<br><br>"Lotta good it does me."<br><br>Squatting down in front of him, Armie said low, "People are watching, so stop whining."<br><br>Justice's gaze slipped past him and he groaned.<br><br>"Yeah, the big dogs are here again." Damned nosy bastards. Ever since he'd signed with the SBC, the powers-that-be had been scoping him out like their newest lab rat. "Stand up, go another two minutes with me, then we'll call it quits."<br><br>Huffing out a breath, Justice lumbered to his feet. "Freak of nature," he muttered again, but he followed Armie out to the center of the ring, and he did his best.<br><br>His best was nowhere near good enough against Armie.<br><br>But then, they fought for very different reasons.<br><br>Twenty minutes later, fresh from the showers, Armie was ready to head out. The mid-February weather left frost on every surface, so he tugged on a stocking hat over his still-wet hair and pulled a thick hooded sweatshirt on over his clothes. Carrying his gym bag, he entered the main area cautiously. This late in the day, the mats were now cleared. Miles and Brand took their turn mopping with sanitizer. Many of the lights were turned down and only the core group of friends remained, clustered together in conversation.<br><br>The SBC heads were gone, and better still, he didn't see Merissa anywhere. She'd probably just been dropping off paperwork for her brother, Cannon, who owned the rec center.<br><br>Relieved, Armie started for the door. With any luck, he'd manage it before someone stopped him&#x2014;<br><br>"Hey, Armie."<br><br>Damn. After a slight hesitation, he turned to where Denver, Stack and Cannon all stood together. "What's this? The three Married Musketeers?"<br><br>Stack, who'd only married a month ago, reeked of satisfaction. "Aw, he's jealous."<br><br>Yup. But since he'd die before admitting it, Armie said, "Nope."<br><br>Denver, still a newlywed himself, grinned. "Probably lonely, too, poor guy."<br><br>Very. Groupies, orgies and random one-night stands could only take a guy so far. He had a rep for sexual excess, and that's what the ladies wanted from him. That, and nothing more.<br><br>Checking the time, Armie said, "I could be lonely with three very nice ladies if you yahoos would let me leave."<br><br>Unlike the others, Cannon didn't laugh. "Seriously?<br><br>Again?"<br><br>Why the hell did his best friend have to sound so disapproving? And if he knew why Armie had made those plans, he'd probably be pissed as well as disapproving, because it was thoughts of Cannon's little sis that he worked so hard to obliterate. Not that a foursome would accomplish much beyond taking the edge off. His obsession with Merissa seemed to amplify by the day.<br><br>Copping an attitude, Armie shrugged. "Yeah, really. Unless you have something&#x2014;" <em>or someone</em> "&#x2014;better for me to do?"<br><br>"As a matter of fact, that's why I wanted to talk to you."<br><br>Well hell. He hadn't figured on that. Armie ran a hand over his hair. "Then let's hear it."<br><br>"Yvette wanted everyone to come over tonight to hang out and visit."<br><br>Armie adored Yvette. She was perfect for Cannon and a real sweetheart. But damn... "Who all will be there?"<br><br>With a very knowing smile, Cannon said, "Everyone important to us. So don't miss it."<br><br>Double damn. Merissa definitely counted as important.<br><br>Armie didn't want to, but with all the guys eyeballing him, how could he refuse? "What time?"<br><br>"Now."<br><br>Armie scowled. "What do you mean, now?"<br><br>"Now, as in you don't have time to do anything else, so forget it."<br><br>Justice came dragging out, his faux-hawk hair still wet, his goatee in need of a trim, and his cauliflower ears worse than ever. He shoulder-bumped Armie as he passed. "If you hadn't been determined to cripple me, maybe you'd have had more time for playing."<br><br>"Wuss," Armie accused with a grin.<br><br>"He has a point," Brand said as he pushed a mop bucket toward them.<br><br>Miles, giving one last swipe of the mat, followed him. "Keep pushing that hard and you're liable to hurt something before the competition."<br><br>"I still have two months." Two months of freedom and he'd spend it however he wanted. Sure, Armie knew there were established training methods, but they weren't for him. Never had been, never would be&#x2014;no matter who he fought for.<br><br>"This isn't local fighting anymore," Denver reminded him.<br><br>As if he'd forget.<br><br>"Carter Fletcher isn't a slouch," Miles added. "You might not walk through him like you do the local guys."<br><br>"They call him Chaos for a reason." Brand frowned. "I've seen him fight and he's unpredictable."<br><br>Yeah, so his first opponent was supposed to be a stud. Big deal. Armie shrugged to show he didn't really care. Not that long ago the SBC, the most widely known MMA organization, had run him to ground and all but coerced him into signing on with them. Cannon had helped with that, pushing him to take the next step since he'd already demolished all the records in local venues.<br><br>It was a big step, too, something all the other guys had worked for. The SBC paid a lot more and offered incredible name recognition. Their fighters traveled the world to compete.<br><br>But Armie liked being low-key; it was a hell of a lot safer for multiple reasons. If it wasn't for Cannon&#x2014;<br><br>"He'll do fine against Carter," Cannon said. "And don't worry about his training. Armie motivates differently, that's all."<br><br>Always, no matter what, Cannon had his back. As the only other person to know why he'd avoided fame and fortune, Cannon understood. They weren't related, but they were brothers all the same.<br><br>Which was the second biggest reason he couldn't, shouldn't, crave Merissa the way he did. Cannon protected those he loved.<br><br>And he loved his sister a lot.<br><br>"It's getting late," Cannon added. "Don't want to keep Yvette waiting."<br><br>Glad for the switch in topic, Armie pulled out his phone. "Guess I better make some calls and let the ladies know I won't make it after all."<br><br>Stack looked at Denver. "If it was anyone but Armie, I'd think he was making it up."<br><br>"Lonely," Denver confirmed. Armie walked away knowing they were right.<br><br>Merissa Colter leaned against the counter in the kitchen, sipping a wine cooler and watching as Yvette prepared a platter of lunch meat and cheeses. "You sure you don't want my help?"<br><br>Yvette flashed her a happy smile. "There's not that much to do. Besides, you're dressed so cute tonight, I don't want to risk you getting messy."<br><br>Looking down at herself, Merissa said, "I just felt like a change, you know?"<br><br>Smile sly, Yvette nodded, then wiped her hands on the apron she wore. "It's nice for a lady to switch things up every now and then. And with your long legs, that's a good look for you."<br><br>"Vanity shopped with me." Vanity was Yvette's best friend, now Stack's wife, and a regular fashion plate without trying. "She insisted on the boots."<br><br>"With heels," Yvette enthused, since Merissa almost always wore flats. "I approve."<br><br>"It's just that I'm so blasted tall&#x2014;"<br><br>"Like a model."<br><br>"I don't know." More often than not, she felt gangly, not model-worthy.<br><br>"Trust me," Yvette said as she laid out the last pieces of cheese on her lunch-meat display. "You'd be terrific. Everything you wear looks amazing on you. You're slim but still shapely."<br><br>Merissa choked over that. "I'm barely in a B cup. Nothing shapely about that."<br><br>From the kitchen doorway came a sound and Merissa looked up to see Brand, Miles and Leese all standing there grinning at her. They were all three gorgeous, all three buff, all three talented.<br><br>But none of them were Armie.<br><br>How she felt about them, and vice versa, wasn't anything close to romantic. But still, heat rushed into her face. After all, they'd just heard her discussing her boobs.<br><br>Looking around for a weapon, Merissa grabbed up the dishcloth and threw it at them. "Pretend you didn't hear that!"<br><br>"Too late." Leese caught the towel, then carried it over to the sink. "Whatever you think you're missing, let me tell you, it's all there." He looked back at the other two fighters. "Am I right?"<br><br>"Hell, yeah."<br><br>"Definitely."<br><br>Humiliated, but appreciating their input, Merissa laughed. "You guys are my friends. You have to say that."<br><br>Crossing his heart, Leese insisted, "Honest truth." He snagged three beers from the fridge, then tossed one to Brand and the other to Miles.<br><br>With his sinfully dark gaze moving over her, Brand stepped farther into the kitchen. "And that getup?" He cocked a brow. "Smokin' hot."<br><br>She suddenly felt very conspicuous in her V-necked tunic sweater, tights and ankle boots.<br><br>"There, you see?" Yvette said. "You're gorgeous. Who cares if you're not top-heavy?"<br><br>She cared.<br><br>"It's the whole package," Miles insisted. He and Brand both had dark hair, but Miles's eyes were bright green, his smile crooked, and he flirted with every woman alive. "Trust me."<br><br>Leese ran a hand over his inky-black hair, his pale blue eyes playful. "I'm an ass man, myself." He winked, letting her know she fit the bill.<br><br>It was a wonder she could think at all when surrounded by so many certified hunks. Maybe if she felt about one of them the way she felt about Armie, her life would be easier.<br><br>Yvette started forcing them all from the kitchen. "Stop embarrassing her."<br><br>"We were reassuring her," Brand protested.<br><br>The guys dragged their feet, making Yvette work at getting them clear of the door. After they'd gone, Yvette's smile lingered and her eyes were warm with happiness.<br><br>Merissa knew something was going on. Both her brother and Yvette <em>glowed.</em> Setting aside her wine cooler, she asked, "So, what's up with you and Cannon?"<br><br>Humming, Yvette got down a bowl and filled it with chips. "I don't know what you mean."<br><br>"Uh-huh."<br><br>Just then Armie stuck his head in the kitchen. "Hey, Yvette..." His voice trailed off when he spotted Merissa.<br><br>Expression arrested, Armie's attention crawled down her body, taking in every detail. His chest expanded on a slow breath. Merissa didn't move. Seeing him had an entirely different effect on her than she'd had with the other men. Just about everyone had commented on her new duds. But this was Armie. She didn't want his opinion to matter&#x2014;yet it did.<br><br>Belatedly, his gaze came back up to her face and locked with hers. His jaw flexed. His dark eyes consumed her and just when she thought she'd pass out from lack of oxygen, he started to turn away.<br><br>Clearly Armie hadn't expected to see her and hadn't wanted to see her. It hurt.<br><br>Yvette stopped him. "Armie! Come on in. What would you like to drink?"<br><br>With his back to them, he stalled. Muscles shifted in his shoulders, his upper arms&#x2014;then he very deliberately relaxed and faced them again. The heat in his eyes had cooled to indifference and his cocky smile almost made her believe she'd imagined the tension.<br><br>"I'm good."<br><br>Merissa snorted. She didn't mean to. It just came out.<br><br>His dark sinner's gaze zeroed back in on her. "Something funny, Stretch?"<br><br>God, how she hated that nickname! It emphasized her height, but worse, it proved that Armie didn't see her as a desirable woman. "You? Being good?" She snorted again. "I hope I'm not standing close when lightning strikes you."<br><br>Stepping the rest of the way into the kitchen, he said to Yvette, "I'll take a beer."<br><br>"Sure." Yvette poured an unsweetened tea. She handed it to Armie, kissed his cheek, then picked up the platter and carried it to the dining room.<br><br>Nonplussed, Armie looked at the glass.<br><br>Merissa looked at Armie.<br><br>Until recently he'd kept his hair bleached almost white, but lately he'd left it alone and now it was back to a more natural dark blond. Still a little spiky, but not such a dramatic contrast to his chocolate-brown eyes.<br><br>Tattoos lined his forearms, and though she couldn't see it right now, not with him wearing a shirt, she knew he had another, more understated tat between his shoulder blades.<br><br>Faded jeans sat low on his lean hips, hanging a little long over running shoes. Boldly displayed across the front of his snug-fitting black T-shirt were the words FREE ORGASMS.<br><br>Merissa cleared her throat. "Don't like tea?"</p><h2>Creation, Sin, Covenant, and Salvation: A Primer for Biblical Theology</h2><p>Creation, Covenant, Sin, and Salvation is a primer for biblical theology that is accessible to lay readers of all ages.

There an odd and amiable band of nature lovers devote themselves to observing and protecting the park's rich wildlife. When a pair of red-tailed hawks builds a nest atop a Fifth Avenue apartment house across the street from the model-boat pond, Marie Winn and her fellow "Regulars" are soon transformed into obsessed hawkwatchers. The hilarious and occasionally heartbreaking saga of Pale Male and his mate as they struggle to raise a family in their unprecedented nest site, and the affectionate portrait of the humans who fall under their spell will delight and inspire readers for years to come.</p><p>The literature of bird watching is full of memoirs set in out-of-the-way, rural locales, but few are set in the heart of big cities such as New York, where <i>Wall Street Journal</i> ornithology columnist Marie Winn hangs her hat. In this delightful account, Winn tells of birding in Central Park with an unlikely band of fellow enthusiasts (including Mary Tyler Moore and Woody Allen). Among her objects of study were a pair of increasingly uncommon wood thrushes who set up their nest in the park's Ramble, treating city dwellers to their "penetrating, flutelike, heart-stoppingly beautiful song: Ee-oh-lee, ee-oh-loo-ee-lee, ee-lay-loo," and a pair of red-tail hawks who courted, mated, and produced offspring, thus quickening the spirits of Manhattanites. Both urbanites and those inclined to country matters will enjoy Winn's gracefully written story of observation and discovery."Red-Tails in Love is a witty, tender, and beguiling record of two striking Central Park-dwelling species--the red-tailed hawks on their Fifth Avenue stick nest, and the flock of binoculared 'Regulars' at their Hawk Bench. Seemingly written by someone who is part bird, the book is a lively interweaving of the family saga of Pale Male and his variously doomed mates with the tale of the Regulars' fidelity to their self-appointed roles as Nest Patrol, Feeding Squad, ombudspersons, and safety netters. Red-Tails in Love explains why some humans belong to the ardent, obsessed subspecies known as 'birdwatcher.'" <br>--Galway Kinnell <br> <br>"Marie Winn brings the eye of a superb nature writer to the human and avian life of Central Park, and the result is a delightful book that leaves the reader with a new respect for the sheer power of nature in the face of all odds to claim its rightful place in the city." <br>--Michael Pollan <br> <br>"Red-tailed hawks hovering above Fifth Avenue become the inspiration for daily inquiries into how one touches wildness in the heart of a city. Marie Winn gives us a book of reverie." <br>--Terry Tempest Williams <br> <br>"This book has a rare charm, beguiling the innocent reader who thinks it's about birdwatching into a wonderland of many levels. After reading it I walked across Central Park on a familiar route and saw New York City, in face the whole urban experience, with very different eyes and spirit." <br>--Robert MacNeil</p><h2>Abraham Lincoln: A Biography</h2><p>Lord Charnwood&#39;s remains the best Lincoln biography. -William Kristol, The Weekly Standard</p><p>No other narrative account of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s life has inspired such widespread acclaim as Lord Charnwood&#39;s Abraham Lincoln: a biography. Many contemporary historians consider this thorough and superbly crafted work the quintessential biography of one of America&#39;s greatest presidents. Written by a native of England and originally published in 1916, the biography is a rare blend of beautiful prose and profound historical insight. Charnwood&#39;s study of Lincoln&#39;s statemanship introduced generations of Americans to the life and politics of Lincoln, and the author&#39;s observations are so comprehensive and well supported that any serious study of Lincoln must respond to his conclusions. This is essential reading for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, or American political history.Charnwood was born in England, was a member of the British Parliament as a liberal, where he supported home rule for Ireland.</p><h2>The Hawk in the Rain: Poems</h2><p>Originally published in 1957, <i>Hawk in the Rain</i> was the first collection of poems by Ted Hughes. The book won the New York Poetry Center First Publication Award, for which the judges were W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, and Marianne Moore; it also won the Somerset Maugham Award. Indeed, <i>Hawk in the Rain</i> was acclaimed by every reviewer from A. Alvarez to Edwin Muir, and in its pages we can still see the promising brilliance of one of the most important English-speaking poets of the modern age.<br></p><p>The British poet, translator, author, and critic <b>Ted Hughes</b>, born in 1930, wrote more than forty books, including, in the last decade of his life, <i>Shakespeare and the Goddess of Complete Being</i>; <i>Tales from Ovid</i>; verse adaptations of Aeschylus's <i>Oresteia</i>, Racine's <i>Ph�dre</i>, and Euripedes' <i>Alcestis</i>; and the bestselling <i>Birthday Letters</i>.

It affects many people, but when it impacts pastors they are often tempted to ignore the critical needs of the pastoral disciplines that ensure the effectiveness of ministry.In Thinking, Listening, and Being: Wesleyan Pastoral Disciplines, Jeren Rowell offers theological reflections on what it means to live and work as a pastor. He examines different aspects of pastoral thinking, practice, and work, and challenges pastors to continually pursue prayer, the study of Scriptures, and theological reflection.&#x2019;Working in this way,&#x2019; he writes, &#x2019;could not only be a gift of love for the church but also an important model for parish pastors who are tempted to surrender first things to the urgencies and temptations of contemporary life.&#x2019;</p><p>Jeren Rowell serves as district superintendent of the Kansas City District Church of the Nazarene and has pastored more than 25 years.

I have decided it is time to name my successor!? she tells the surprised crowd. Sophie, an energetic and very tiny mouse, desperately wants the job. ?C'est moi!? Sophie thinks. ?Choose me! Choose me!? But the position of Tooth Mouse --- or La Petite Souris --- isn't just given to anyone; it must be earned by participating in a difficult and dangerous three-part contest to determine which of all the mouse applicants is the most brave, honest and wise. Will Sophie, the smallest and daintiest of the aspirants, manage to beat the odds and win the challenging competition for her dream job?<br><br>In the style of a classic fable, this gentle yet inspiring story is sure to captivate young children with the delightful idea of a small mouse making her way under the pillows of sleeping children at night instead of the Tooth Fairy.

On a winter morning in 1761 six men leave Copenhagen by sea&#x2014;a botanist, a philologist, an astronomer, a doctor, an artist, and their manservant&#x2014;an ill-assorted band of men who dislike and distrust one another from the start. These are the members of the Danish expedition to Arabia Felix, as Yemen was then known, the first organized foray into a corner of the world unknown to Europeans. The expedition made its way to Turkey and Egypt, by which time its members were already actively seeking to undercut and even kill one another, before disappearing into the harsh desert that was their destination. Nearly seven years later a single survivor returned to Denmark to find himself forgotten and all the specimens that had been sent back ruined by neglect. <br><br>Based on diaries, notebooks, and sketches that lay unread in Danish archives until the twentieth century, <i>Arabia Felix </i>is a tale of intellectual rivalry and a comedy of very bad manners, as well as an utterly absorbing adventure.<br><br><i>Arabia Felix</i> includes 33 line drawings and maps.</p><p><b>Thorkild Hansen </b>(1927&#x2013;1989) was born in Ordrup, Denmark, and studied literature at the University of Copenhagen for two years before moving to Paris in 1947.

He returned to Denmark in 1952 and published his first full-length novel, <i>Resten er Stilhed</i> (The Rest Is Silence) in 1953. Hansen would go on to write more than two dozen books, many of which drew on the historical record to interrogate Denmark&#x2019;s record of imperialism, including <i>Pausesignaler</i> (Pause Signals, 1959); <i>Jens Munk</i> (1965), which won the Golden Laurel Award; a trilogy about the Danish slave trade (1967&#x2013;1970), the final volume of which won the Nordic Council Prize; and <i>Processen mod Hamsun</i> (The Case Against Hamsun, 1978).

Now she rules at his side as Abhorsen, the sole necromancer of the Old Kingdom, keeping the people safe from the dark power of Free Magic. But this is not just Sabriel's tale. It is also the story of Hedge, a mysterious necromancer who is digging up a monstrous evil that could utterly destroy the Old Kingdom. And it is the story of Prince Sameth, Touchstone and Sabriel's only son, who would rather fight an entire army of Dead than disappoint his beloved parents. And Sam's friend Nick, who has unknowingly loosed Free Magic into the Old Kingdom, blissfully ignorant of its complete malevolence.

So we repeatedly mull it over until we can no longer put it off, and then finally stumble through the confrontation. <i>Difficult Conversations</i>, by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen, offers advice for handling these unpleasant exchanges in a manner that accomplishes their objective and diminishes the possibility that anyone will be needlessly hurt. The authors, associated with Harvard Law School and the Harvard Project on Negotiation, show how such dialogues actually comprise three separate components: the "what happened" conversation (verbalizing what we believe really was said and done), the "feelings" conversation (communicating and acknowledging each party's emotional impact), and the "identity" conversation (expressing the situation's underlying personal meaning). The explanations and suggested improvements are, admittedly, somewhat complicated. And they certainly don't guarantee positive results. But if you honestly are interested in elevating your communication skills, this book will walk you through both mistakes and remedies in a way that will boost your confidence when such unavoidable clashes arise. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>Q: What is a difficult conversation? <p>A: Think about your own life. Is there an upcoming conversation that makes you anxious? That you dread or aren't sure whether to even attempt? That keeps you up at night? That's a difficult conversation. It's anything you find it hard to talk about. What is difficult for me may not be difficult for you, so it's hard to generalize in terms of content. But some common examples include giving negative feedback, admitting a mistake, breaking up with someone, expressing strong feelings, talking about sensitive subjects like race or gender, even letting someone know how much we love them. </p><p>Importantly, we've found that there are adjustments people can make both in their assumptions and in how they engage in conversations that can greatly improve the chances that their conversations will go well. And that's why we wrote the book. </p><p>Q: What would you say are the three biggest mistakes people make in difficult conversations? </p><p>A: The biggest mistake people make is rooted in a very basic assumption: that we are right, and the other person is wrong. What are we right about? We're right that you drive too fast. We're right that your comments during the meeting were inappropriate. We're right that we deserve a raise, that the contractor overcharged me, or that our boss is sexist. </p><p>The problem is, we're not right. Difficult conversations are never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting perceptions, feelings, and values. They're not about what a contract says, they're about what the contract means. They are not about which child-rearing book is most popular, they're about which child-rearing book we should follow. They're not about what's true, they are about what is important. </p><p>This first mistake assuming that we're right, and the conversation is about getting them to see that we're right leads us to make the second biggest mistake. It seems trivial, but it's actually profound: we don't ask enough questions. If you read a transcript of a difficult conversation, you'll see that about 90% of what is said is advocacy, and only 10% is inquiry. That's a recipe for disaster, especially since if we're going to learn more about why we see and interpret things differently, we need to understand how you see things first. So when your neighbor yells at you for making too much noise, don't yell back. Ask questions. What's going on with her, why is the noise so upsetting? What is she imagining the standards of noise level should be? The better you understand her, the better your conversation will go. </p><p>Third, we assume that to solve the problem, we should stay rational and avoid feelings. Feelings are messy and distracting. But when feelings are part of the problem, and usually they are at the very heart of difficult conversations, then you can't handle the problem well without also addressing how people are feeling. The issue is not just that your husband keeps coming home late, it's that you feel hurt and lonely. It's not just that someone on the team isn't pulling their weight, it's how others are feeling unsupported, unfairly treated, or let down. If you're going to get to the heart of the problem, then feelings are central to the discussion. </p><p>Q: What are three keys to handling a difficult conversation well? </p><p>A: First, make sure you know your purpose. NASA doesn't send up the space shuttle and then try to decide the purpose of the mission. And you shouldn't launch into a difficult conversation without first considering what it is you hope to accomplish. If you're thinking, 'I want to have a conversation because I'm upset,' or 'I just think we need to talk,' that's not good enough. Your purpose needs to be forward-looking. Do you want the other person to understand you better? Do you want them to apologize? Is there a problem you want the two of you to work out? </p><p>Second, ask yourself what reaction the other person might have that is most likely to throw you off balance. Are you thrown off balance when someone cries? Accuses you of bad intentions? Rejects you? Gets angry? Withdraws? Identify which reactions are toughest for you to deal with and why. And then plan for how you might respond. </p><p>Third, take the pressure off yourself. Difficult conversations are part of life. Sure, you can become more skilled at having them, but they're never going to go away, and having a rough time now and then doesn't mean you're incompetent. Often, especially at the beginning of a conversation, we find ourselves tongue-tied, or just plain scared, and we can't articulate what we want or need to say. But the goal is not eloquence, it's openness and honesty. If you remember not to put too much pressure on yourself to manage the conversation perfectly, and you stick with it, over time, you and the other person will come to a better understanding, and perhaps, an improved relationship. </p><p>Q: Are there times when it's better just to walk away from a difficult conversation? </p><p>A: Absolutely, yes. You can't have a conversation every time your boss or spouse ticks you off. There's too little time in the day. But neither should you make the opposite mistake. Too often, we shy away from having conversations because we think they'll be hard. And that's true, the conversation may be hard. But not having it isn't cost-free either. Your feelings will fester, and you'll wonder why you don't stick up for yourself. The problems persist unaddressed. And in the long run, not raising important issues is likely to be more damaging to relationships than the pain caused by raising them. </p><p>Q: What is the 'third story' and why is it important? </p><p>A: As the old saying goes, 'There are two sides to every story.' Well, the old saying is wrong. Every story has three sides, and it's this third side what we call the 'third story' that you want to get familiar with before you have a difficult conversation. The third story is neither your story nor the other person's story. Instead, it's the story a mediator or impartial friend would tell about what's going on. It's how they might describe without agreeing with either of us what the issues or differences are between us. </p><p>Imagine that you and your roommate argue over the dishes. My story is you're an inconsiderate slob. Your story is that I'm obsessively neat. If I begin the conversation from inside my story by saying, 'We need to talk about the fact that you're a slob,' you're going to get defensive. If we begin from your story, I'm going to be defensive. So we're stuck. How to begin? The answer is to 'begin from the third story,' which would sound like this: 'You and I have different preferences around when the dishes get done. Let's try to talk about that.' That's a story we can both sign onto, and this gets us off to a good start. </p><p>Q: Is it true that women are better at handling difficult conversations than men? </p><p>A: Contrary to conventional wisdom, it's our experience that men and women handle difficult conversations equally well that is to say, equally poorly. It may be that women care more or even talk more about feelings, but that doesn't translate into increased skill in dealing with them. No matter who we are or what gender we each have certain feelings we find hard to discuss, certain relationships that stretch us to the limits of our capacity to deal with them. And we all fall into the same conversational traps, and make the same wrong-headed assumptions that lead to trouble. It's not about gender, it's about being human. </p><p>Q: How can your method work if only one of the two people involved is using it? </p><p>A: Do you mean to say there are people out there who haven't read our book? Well, the good news is, these techniques are designed to be used even with those people who are determined to make your conversations as unpleasant as possible. </p><p>Having a conversation is like taking a road trip in one of those cars used to teach people how to drive the ones with two steering wheels. You can steer the conversation, but so can the other person. Which means that neither of you is fully in control. </p><p>So you'll head in a useful direction, and the other person will send both of you careening toward a telephone pole. The key is learning to keep the car on the road, and in difficult conversations, that means re-framing unhelpful comments into constructive comments. If your kid calls you a jerk, you can reframe by saying: 'It sounds like you're feeling really upset at something I did.' If your parents tell you how irresponsible you are for staying out late at night, you can begin by appreciating the fact that they care about your well-being. Almost anything, no matter how negative, can be re-framed into something constructive. </p><p>Q: What if you're absolutely sure that you're right and the other person is wrong? For instance, what if you're having a conversation with your daughter about her smoking being bad for her? Does the suggestion to 'understand the other person's story' still apply? </p><p>A: You are right. Smoking is bad for your daughter's health. But here's the catch: That's not what this conversation is really about. Your daughter knows that smoking is bad for her. What makes the conversation difficult are the strong feelings and perceptions each of you have about smoking, and about each other. What does smoking mean to her? Does it help her relax? Fit in with her friends? Feel independent? And what does it mean to you? What are your fears about her health? Your sense of not having control over her behavior? Your frustration with her lack of interest in talking about it? </p><p>As long as you're stuck on proving to her that you're right, you miss the boat entirely. If instead, you describe your feelings, and elicit your daughter's, you may actually have an impact on her. And in any event, you'll understand each other better, and keep the channels open to discuss the issue of smoking down the road. </p><p>Q: Say I have to fire someone. In most difficult conversations the outcome is dependent upon the other person's story, but in this situation I have the sole power to impose the outcome. What's the point of understanding the other person's story here? </p><p>A: Having the power to impose an outcome shouldn't turn a dialogue into a monologue. Even firing someone should be a two-way conversation. Why? Because being willing to listen to their reactions, to sit with their anger, disappointment, or fear, has few risks and may have enormous payoffs for the person being fired, and for your company. First, you may learn something about why this employee hasn't worked out. From their point of view, what has the company contributed to their failure? Not enough training? Unclear direction? Poor treatment by a supervisor? You may be alerted to problems that don't end when this person walks out the door. </p><p>Second, you demonstrate that you care about this person as a human being. This may be important for your own sense of compassion and desire to help, and that's reason enough to do it. But it's also good for the bottom line. Why do people sue? Often it's because they feel unfairly treated, and they can't get anyone to listen to them. Not to agree with them, but to listen. So filing suit and getting their day in court is the only avenue they see for getting your attention and having a chance to tell their story. And at the most extreme, not feeling listened to is one of the factors that drives people to do dangerous or destructive things. Whether it's trashing their office, stealing a client, badmouthing the organization or sabotaging a computer system, the frustration behind this kind of striking out is sometimes linked to whether the former employee felt heard and cared about by any one person inside the organization. </p><p>Q: What suggestions can you offer for how to deliver bad news in general? </p><p>A: Nothing that'll make it good news. But you can avoid making the impact worse than it needs to be. Our advice is this: be direct. Put the bad news up front rather than at the end. (You may want to give people a one sentence signal, so they can prepare themselves internally, but it doesn't help to beat around the bush or 'start with the positive,' if there is a big 'But' coming.) </p><p>Take responsibility for your contribution to the way things worked out, and don't try to control the other person's reaction give them the space to be upset. If the news is bad, it's normal for the other person to feel hurt or angry, and trying to convince them that things aren't as bad as they seem will only convince them that you don't really understand how they feel. Of course, as we said above, you should try to be empathetic, and listen as non-defensively as you are able. </p><p>At the same time, it's appropriate to defend yourself from unfair or abusive responses. The fact that the other person is upset doesn't give them license to say things that aren't true, or to blame you for all of their problems. You can be clear, compassionate and responsible, and still defend yourself from accusations that you feel are inappropriate. </p><p>Q: Your method advocates the importance of revealing one's feelings. Is it always a good idea to reveal feelings, or is it sometimes better to conceal them? </p><p>A: You don't want to be walking around all day long blabbing about your feelings. That's exhausting not only for you, but for everyone around you. </p><p>But when the relationship is important and your feelings are strong and they remain strong even after you've given the matter some thought you may want to discuss how you're feeling. The truth is that if your feelings are strong enough, they'll be communicated one way or another. They'll either leak out through your body language and tone of voice, or worse, you'll lose the internal fight to repress them and you'll explode. So the question isn't, 'Should you express your feelings or hide them?' The real question is, 'How should you express your feelings? Directly and clearly, or indirectly and inappropriately?' </p><p>Q: Do you have any tips on how to make talking about your feelings easier? </p><p>A: A friend of ours asked us for some difficult conversations advice recently. He visited his friend in the hospital every day for a week, and when his friend recovered, she never once thanked him. </p><p>We advised him to share his feelings with his friend. 'I already tried that,' he griped, 'and it was a disaster! In situations like this, sharing feelings just doesn't help.' </p><p>'What did you actually say to her?' we asked. </p><p>'I told her my feelings. I said she was thoughtless and selfish. And all it did was start a fight.' </p><p>Our friend made the classic mistake of confusing judgments with feelings. They seem the same but they're not. There's a huge difference between saying, 'You're selfish,' which is a judgment, and saying, 'I felt hurt,' which is a feeling. People react to judgments by defending themselves and fighting back. People usually react to the expression of actual feelings much more sympathetically and productively. </p><p>Our friend went back and talked to his friend again. This time, he avoided making a judgment, and instead said 'I feel hurt that you didn't thank me.' His friend listened patiently to what he was feeling and why, and then apologized. The conversation was not easy; our friend felt vulnerable and awkward.

Jan uses the term <i>spiritual friendship</i> to capture this idea of journeying with others through life, sharing experiences and wisdom and seeking God together.

You can have rich, rewarding, faith-filled friendships that emerge from the everyday rhythms of your days&#x2015;and <i>Becoming Gertrude</i> will lead you on that journey.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in&#x2015;I&#x2019;ll get us some lemonade.&#x201d;<br><br>With those words, a teenage Jan Peterson was welcomed onto her Southern neighbor&#x2019;s back porch and into a lifelong bond of friendship.

The cry of &#x201c;Gold!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Silver!&#x201d; or a few flecks of color in a tin cup sent them to remote, often inhospitable locations to search for the precious metals.</p> <p>Close on the heels of the miners were the merchant, the gamblers, the prostitutes, the washerwomen, the capitalists, and the con men. Together they turned the mining camps into bustling towns where saloons never closed and the safest place for a man to walk after dark was down the middle of the street with a gun in each hand.</p> <p><em>Colorado Ghost Towns and Mining Camps</em> is the first new book in more than twenty-five years to document these mountain communities. Most of the early settlers are gone, leaving few persons with any oral tradition to pass on to future generations. For many of the 147 towns and camps listed in this book, not much remains to be preserved beyond what Dallas and photographer Kendal Atchison have recorded.</p> <p>The book is lavishly illustrated with 290 photographs. In addition to those by Atchison and early historical photographs, rare photographs from the 1920s and 1930s are included, many never published before. Some of Atchison&#x2019;s superb photographs evoke nostalgia with views of abandoned buildings deteriorating amid meadow wildflowers. Soon nothing will remain but the Colorado landscape, with the eternal mountains towering close by.</p> <p>The town histories are traced from their beginning in strike-it-rich excitement and glittering boom years, through the declines, to the present day. Some of these hopeful towns, such as Lulu, were deserted as quickly as they were settled, lasting barely more than a season, while a few, including Aspen and Breckenridge, are as lively today as they were a century ago. But most of them, like Animas Forks, flourished until the gold or silver played out and were abandoned, leaving a few lonely cabins or picturesque ruins. Towns such as Aspen, Crested Butte, Cripple Creek, and Breckenridge have lived on to become popular ski resorts, and these places warrant additional vignettes that add color and to the text.</p> <p>Written to inform and entertain the general reader, this book will be a delight for armchair adventurers as well as invaluable for vacationers interested in visiting the sites of these Colorado boomtowns. Most of the places are no longer shown on modern road maps, and special maps of the region have been prepared for this book.</p></p><p><b>Sandra Dallas,</b> a reporter for <i>Business Week</i> for twenty-five years, is the author of <i>Colorado Ghost Towns and Mining Camps,&nbsp;</i><i>No More Than Five in a Bed </i>(also published by the University of Oklahoma Press), <i>Gaslights and Gingerbread, </i>many other books and articles on Colorado and the West, and several best-selling novels.<br><br><p><strong>Kendal Atchison</strong>, a talented young photographer, is Sandra Dallas?s daughter.

But first she has to journey to California to be reunited with her mother and brother. No sooner does she arrive there than she learns that Malcolm X has been assassinated.<br><br>Devastated, she tries to put her life back together, working on the stage in local theaters and even conducting a door-to-door survey in Watts. Then Watts explodes in violence, a riot she describes firsthand.<br><br>Subsequently, on a trip to New York, she meets Martin Luther King, Jr., who asks her to become his coordinator in the North, and she visits black churches all over America to help support King&#x2019;s Poor People&#x2019;s March.<br><br>But once again tragedy strikes. King is assassinated, and this time Angelou completely withdraws from the world, unable to deal with this horrible event. Finally, James Baldwin forces her out of isolation and insists that she accompany him to a dinner party&#x2014;where the idea for writing <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> is born. In fact, <b><i>A Song Flung Up to Heaven</i>ends as Maya Angelou begins to write the first sentences of <i>Caged Bird</i>.<br></b></p><p>It's been a long time coming, but <i>A Song Flung Up to Heaven</i> triumphantly completes the six volumes of autobiography that began nearly 30 years ago with Maya Angelou's astonishingly successful <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i>, a work that changed readers' perceptions of what autobiographical writing could achieve. The impact of <i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</i> (which evoked the author's adolescence and sexual abuse in Arkansas) was unprecedented. It combined frankness and emotional force with a nuanced, poetic style--a style that Angelou has perhaps found more elusive recently. But it's here again, as affecting as ever. The book deals with the years 1964-68, a turbulent period in which Angelou came back to America after her African sojourn. This, of course, was the time of the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King; Angelou was on the point of working with the latter in the civil rights movement. Her voice is fresh and exhilarating as she deals with the tragedies and triumphs of a packed life, and there are some set-piece moments, such as her account of the misguided revenge she took on an ex-lover. <p> Many women have become celebrated as writers and poets, but Angelou has also enjoyed a distinguished career as a civil rights activist, producer, performer, actress, and filmmaker. With all of this under her belt, she can be forgiven for the note of self-congratulation that creeps in at times. But for those who've followed her unique writing, this is a journey into a fascinating life and a riveting picture of a divided America, always informed with that clear-sighted vision Angelou is famous for. <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings<br><br>&#x201c;I know that not since the days of my childhood, when people in<br>books were more real than the people one saw every day,<br>have I found myself so moved.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;James Baldwin<br><br>Gather Together in My Name<br><br>&#x201c;Gather Together in My Name is part of a select body of literature that includes The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Claude Brown&#x2019;s<br>Manchild in the Promised Land and Ernest J.

The author embraces the perspectives of both the betrayer and the betrayed, forcing us to participate in lives that we might otherwise condemn, and to recognize the kinship of those lives to our own.</p></p><p><p>Tobias Wolff was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up in Washington State.

Illuminated manuscripts and illustrated or decorated books&#x2014;like today&#x2019;s museums&#x2014;preserve a rich array of information about how premodern peoples conceived of and perceived the world, its many cultures, and everyone&#x2019;s place in it. Often a Eurocentric field of study, manuscripts are prisms through which we can glimpse the interconnected global history of humanity.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Toward a Global Middle Ages</i> is the first publication to examine decorated books produced across the globe during the period traditionally known as medieval. Through essays and case studies, the volume&#x2019;s multidisciplinary contributors expand the historiography, chronology, and geography of manuscript studies to embrace a diversity of objects, individuals, narratives, and materials from Africa, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas&#x2014;an approach that both engages with and contributes to the emerging field of scholarly inquiry known as the Global Middle Ages.<br> &nbsp;<br> Featuring 160 color illustrations, this wide-ranging and provocative collection is intended for all who are interested in engaging in a dialogue about how books and other textual objects contributed to world-making strategies from about 400 to 1600.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Bryan C.

That variegated world, stretching from the Americas to Afro-Eurasia to Austronesia, is offered to the reader through extraordinary images and thoughtful essays that delight, instruct, and surprise us. &nbsp;</p><p>With imagination and verve, Bryan C. Keene curates a selection of essays and images that attest how book arts, in&nbsp;conceptualizing and depicting the lived and imagined worlds of their time, played a complex role in forging early globalisms. Those of us who research, teach, and study a Global Middle Ages (gratifyingly, this volume&#x2019;s editor, unlike many scholars, is alive to the problematic character of this now-popular term for naming&nbsp;the past) are richly rewarded by the perspicacity and diversity exhibited in this sumptuous, magnificent volume. &nbsp;</p><p>This book should be on everyone&#x2019;s shelves.</p><p>&#x2014;Geraldine Heng, founder and director of the Global Middle Ages Project and Perceval Professor at the University of Texas at Austin</p></p><h2>Hard Justice: A Steamy, Action-Filled Bodyguard Romance (Body Armor, 2)</h2><p><b>Playing it safe has never felt so dangerous...&nbsp;</b><br><br>Justice Wallington knows how to harness his strength and intimidating size&#x2014;skills he put to good use first in the MMA cage and now as a bodyguard at the Body Armor agency.

This radical book develops the notion of covenant epistemology--an innovative, biblically compatible, holistic, embodied, life-shaping epistemological vision in which all knowing takes the shape of interpersonal, covenantal relationship. Rather than knowing in order to love, we love in order to know. Meek argues that all knowing is best understood as transformative encounter. Creatively blending insights from a diverse range of conversation partners--including Michael Polanyi, Michael D. Williams, Lesslie Newbigin, Parker Palmer, John Macmurray, Martin Buber, and James Loder--Meek offers critically needed &#34;epistemological therapy&#34; in response to the pervasive and damaging presumptions that those in Western culture continue to bring to efforts to know. The book&#39;s innovative approach--an unfolding journey of discovery-through-dialogue--itself subverts standard epistemological presumptions of timeless linearity. While it offers a sustained and sophisticated philosophical argument, Loving to Know&#39;s texts and textures interweave loosely to effect therapeutic epistemic transformation in the reader.</p><p>Esther Lightcap Meek is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Geneva College in Western P.A. . She is also the author of Longing to Know: The Philosophy of Knowledge for Ordinary People (2003)."Nobody acquainted with philosophical epistemology would associate it with eloquence or passion. So Loving to Know is extraordinary, because this is epistemology presented with both eloquence and passion, addressed to the person 'on the street' but at the same time raising issues that professional philosophers should take account of. In a most creative way, Professor Meeks takes Michael Polanyi's epistemology, which she perceptively and lucidly summarizes, into new terrain. She argues that to come to know as we ought to come to know is to keep covenant. It is to be faithful both to the known and to oneself, the knower. So take and read. And when you do, you will learn that how the book came about is itself an example of the theory, as is the innovative structure of the discussion. The formation and presentation of the theory display the theory."<br>--Nicholas Wolterstorff<br>Noah Porter Professor Emeritus of Philosophical Theology<br>Yale University<br><br>"Esther Meek has given a good gift in Loving to Know, continuing her lifelong reflections on a more human and truthful understanding of knowledge. Drawing on the best of scholarship, she is her own scholar too, offering a unique vision of a covenant epistemology, a way of knowing that is deeply personal and responsible, because it is profoundly relational. A book for every one of us, as we take up the most perennial of human questions, viz. what will we do with what we know?"<br>--Steven Garber<br>Director<br>The Washington Institute<br><br>"This book is a tour de force of clarity, depth, and compelling wisdom. Esther Meek argues that we become what we love and that if we love truth then we must love to engage in the interpersonal dialogue of seeing the world well through the prism of another's heart. Her premise is lived out through dialogue with a range of authors that makes my head spin. She seizes their wisdom and yet pursues it further to the person of Christ than any I have read. This is an epistemologically therapeutic embrace of how to live well in the world of divergent thought that nevertheless longs to reveal Jesus as the center of all true wisdom. It is a breathtaking and beautiful labor."<br>--Dan B. Allender<br>Professor of Counseling Psychology and Founding President<br>Mars Hill Graduate School<br><br>"Loving to Know is a marvelous follow-up to Meek's Longing to Know. Like her earlier work, this is clearly the work of a masterful, compassionate teacher inviting a wide audience to reflect on the nature of knowledge. Here is epistemology for the people, so to speak. In the process, through a rich set of conversation partners, Meek puts her own stamp on a Reformed epistemology that makes love and covenant central to our account of knowing. An excellent achievement."<br>--James K.A.

Today, although the tallgrass prairie has been reduced to a tiny percentage of its former expanse, people are working to restore and reconstruct prairie communities. This lavishly illustrated guide to seeds and seedlings, crafted by Tallgrass Prairie Center botanist Dave Williams and illustrator Brent Butler, will insure that everyone from urban gardeners to grassland managers can properly identify and germinate seventy-two species of tallgrass wildflowers and grasses in eastern North Dakota, eastern South Dakota, southwestern Minnesota, southwestern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, northwestern Indiana, Iowa, eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas, northwestern Missouri, and eastern Oklahoma.</p><p>Williams has created a brilliant, nearly foolproof system of identification and verification. Two primary keys lead to eleven secondary keys that link to characteristic groups of tallgrass plants: seven groups for wildflowers and four groups for grasses. To identify a seedling, use the primary key to discover its place in the secondary key, then turn to that characteristic group to find your seedling. Circles on each full seedling photograph correspond to close-up photographs; triangles on these close-ups illustrate information in the text to further pinpoint identification. Drawings of leaves illuminate exact identification, and enlarged photographs of each seed provide yet another way to confirm identification.</p><p>Thousands of seeds were sprouted in the Tallgrass Prairie Center&#x2019;s greenhouse to provide seedlings close in size and development to those grown in the field near the end of their first season; research and photography took place over four years. Williams&#x2019;s text for each species includes a thorough description, a comparison of similar species, and guidance for germination and growth. A complete glossary supports the text, which is concise but detailed enough to be accessible to beginning prairie enthusiasts.</p><p>Anyone in the Upper Midwest who wishes to preserve the native vegetation of prairie remnants or reconstruct a tallgrass prairie of whatever size&#x2014;from home gardens to schoolyards to roadsides to large acreages&#x2014;will benefit from the hundreds of photographs and drawings and the precise text in this meticulously prepared guide.</p></p><p><p></p><p>Botanist <b>Dave Williams</b> is the program manager for the Prairie Institute at the Tallgrass Prairie Center, University of Northern Iowa. He has been actively engaged in prairie restoration and reconstruction since 1989. The graphic designer for the Tallgrass Prairie Center since 2006, artist <b>Brent Butler</b> has produced many publications on prairie conservation.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;For identification of plants, most books rely upon characteristics of the flowers and fruits. Even then, some plants may prove to be tricky to identify. Dave Williams has written a most innovative book on how to identify prairie plants in their seedling stages. Who would have thought this possible? Williams presents easily workable keys to the seedlings of seventy-two species, including both forbs and grasses, accompanied by superb photographs that use circles and triangles as bullet points for the distinctive features of each seedling. Information on how to distinguish a particular species from look-alikes is also very useful. Anyone wishing to identify prairie plants in their seedling stages must have this fine work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert H. Mohlenbrock, distinguished professor emeritus of botany, Southern Illinois University</p><p></p><br><br><p></p><p>&#x201c;Seedling identification presents many difficult challenges, but help is now available if you are working with midwestern prairie species. <i>The Tallgrass Prairie Center Guide to Seed and Seedling Identification in the Upper Midwest</i> utilizes color photographs and line drawings to illustrate and highlight key characteristics of the seedlings of seventy-two different forbs and grasses often used in prairie reconstructions. Each species is presented on a full page with several illustrations that provide both an overview and a close-up examination of identifying features. The guide excels in helping users visualize the subtleties of morphology that help distinguish species from one another. This in itself makes the guide a valuable resource; add in its descriptions of seed germination biology and habitat information, and you have an indispensable resource for prairie reconstructionists. While seedling identification of most species is never going to be a simple task, this guide should, at the very least, help simplify the problem and increase the accuracy of your seedling identification.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Rosburg, professor of biology, Drake University</p><p></p></p><h2>She&#39;s Not the Man I Married: My Life with a Transgender Husband</h2><p>Helen Boyd's husband, who had long been open about being a cross-dresser, was considering living as a woman full time. Suddenly, Boyd was confronted with the reality of what it would mean if her husband were actually to become a woman &#x2014; socially, legally, and medically. Would Boyd love and desire her partner the same way?<br>Boyd's first book, <i>My Husband Betty,</i> explored the relationships of cross-dressing men and their partners. Now, <i>She's Not the Man I Married</i> is both a sequel and a more expansive examination of gender in relationships. It's for couples who are homosexual or heterosexual, and for readers who fall anywhere along the gender continuum.<br>As Boyd struggles to understand the nature of marriage, passion, and love, she shares her confusion and anger, providing a fascinating observation of the ways in which relationships are gendered, and how we cope, or don't, with the emotional and sexual pressures that gender roles can bring to our marriages and relationships.</p><p>"A straight woman who has been married several years to a crossdressing man gives a thoughtful account of their relationship (as well as the relationships of other crossdressers she knows) in this forthright and revelatory book.... Honest and well researched, this book is likely to become an indispensable guide."<br><br>"I'd consider My Husband Betty essential reading, but even for the educated and seasoned, it is an amazing resource that delves deep into the issues-cultural, political, sexual, historical, psychological-facing crossdressers, their partners, and the various communities they intersect... the work simultaneously transcends crossdressing altogether. It becomes a blueprint for nontraditional relationships: how to communicate honestly about needs and desires, let go of white-picket-fence dreams, and move beyond them to something real." -- Tristan Taormino<br><br>"Boyd discusses with humor and candor ways to come to terms with crossdressing, focusing on issues of identity, trust, and sexuality... this will undoubtedly have a wider appeal to those curious about this subculture. Recommended for public and academic libraries."<br><br>"Boyd never expected to write about transvestites and their partners, yet here is her fascinating account of marriage to a crossdresser.... Boyd's skill as a writer enables readers to enter a relatively hidden existence easily, and perhaps even to appreciate its complexities. Her account, though initially disquieting to some, may well become a standard text in gender studies."I've been preparing myself to lose my husband for the past few years," observes Boyd in this humorous, self-deprecating follow-up to her first memoir, <i>My Husband Betty</i>. "There is another woman, in a sense. My husband is that other woman, or might become her." Delving deeply into the question of gender identity, she explores the role of gender and its impact on how and who we love. Boyd, an androgynous-looking heterosexual woman (often mistaken for a lesbian), is married to a heterosexual man, who for the past few years has been "presenting as female" most of the time." Betty hasn't yet decided to have "the surgery," while Boyd isn't sure she'd be able to stay in the relationship if Betty does fully "transition" into being a woman. When referring to Betty, Boyd switches back and forth from "he" to "she"&#x2014;even within the same sentence&#x2014;portraying the confusion that a "trans person" presents daily in defining gender. Though she covers her complex topic well, and even includes a chapter of sex advice, Boyd's attempts to conceptualize her experience are unnecessarily repetitive. Part love story, part psychological treatise and part cautionary tale, this book will speak most directly to those who are confronting gender's perplexing contradictions. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Does back pain keep you from living a full life? If so, you may be suffering from TMS (Tension Myositis Syndrome)&#x2015;and you don't have to take it anymore!</b><br>Dr. John E. Sarno is a medical pioneer whose mind-body approach has helped patients overcome their back conditions&#x2015;without drugs or dangerous surgery. After identifying stress and other psychological factors in back pain, he demonstrates how many of his patients have then gone on to heal themselves without exercise or other physical therapy. With case histories and the results of in-depth mind-body research, Dr. Sarno's <i>Healing Back Pain </i>describes how patients recognize the emotional roots of their TMS and sever the connections between mental and physical pain.</p></p><p><i>Healing Back Pain</i> promises permanent elimination of back pain without drugs, surgery, or exercise. It should have been titled <i>Understanding TMS Pain</i>, because it discusses one particular cause of back pain--Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS)--and isn't really a program for self-treatment, with only five pages of action plan (and many more pages telling why conventional methods don't work). According to John E. Sarno, M.D., TMS is the major cause of pain in the back, neck, shoulders, buttocks, and limbs--and it is caused not by structural abnormalities but by the mind's effort to repress emotions. He's not saying that your pain is all in your head; rather, he's saying that the battle going on in your mind results in a real physical disorder that may affect muscles, nerves, tendons, or ligaments. An injury may have triggered the disorder, but is not the cause of the amount or intensity of the resulting pain. According to Sarno, the mind tricks you into not facing repressed emotion by making you focus on pain in the body. When this realization sinks in ("and it must sink in, for mere intellectual appreciation of the process is not enough"), the trick doesn't work any more, and there's no need for the pain. (<i>Healing Back Pain</i> should not be used for self-diagnosis. Always consult a physician for chronic or acute back pain.) <i>--Joan Price</i><p><b>DR. JOHN E.

The coded lock was broken and not working, the floor was littered with the trampled butts of cheap cigarettes. Inside the lift the walls were covered with illiterate graffiti, in which the word &#x2018;Spartak&#x2019; figured as often as the usual crude obscenities; the plastic buttons had been burned through with cigarettes and painstakingly plugged with chewing-gum that was now rock-hard.<br><br>The door into the apartment on the fourth floor was a good match for the entrance: some hideous old kind of Soviet artificial leather, cheap aluminium numbers barely held up by their crookedly inserted screws.<br><br>Natasha hesitated for a moment before she pressed the doorbell. She must be insane to hope for anything from a place like this. If you were so crazy or desperate that you decided to try magic, you could just open the newspaper, switch on the TV or listen to the radio. There were serious spiritualist salons, experienced mediums with internationally recognised diplomas . . . It was all still a con, of course. But at least you&#x2019;d be in pleasant surroundings, with pleasant people, not like this last resort for hopeless losers.<br><br>She rang the bell anyway. She didn&#x2019;t want to waste the time she&#x2019;d spent on the journey.<br><br>For a few moments it seemed that the apartment was empty. Then she heard hasty footsteps, the steps of someone in a hurry whose worn slippers are slipping off their feet as they shuffle along. For a brief instant the tiny spy-hole went dark, then the lock grated and the door opened.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, Natasha, is it? Come in, come in . . .&#x2019;<br><br>She had never liked people who spoke too familiarly from the very first meeting. There ought to be a little more formality at first.<br><br>But the woman who had opened the door was already pulling her into the apartment, clutching her unceremoniously by the hand, and with an expression of such sincere hospitality on her ageing, brightly made-up face that Natasha didn&#x2019;t feel strong enough to object.<br><br>&#x2018;My friend told me that you . . .&#x2019; Natasha began.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, I don&#x2019;t know about that, my dear,&#x2019; said her hostess, waving her hands in the air. &#x2018;Oh, don&#x2019;t take your shoes off, I was just going to clean the place up . . . oh, all right then, I&#x2019;ll try to find you a pair of slippers.&#x2019;<br><br>Natasha looked around, concealing her disgust with difficulty.<br><br>The hall wasn&#x2019;t so very small, but it was crammed incredibly full. The light bulb hanging from the ceiling was dull, maybe thirty watts at best, but even that couldn&#x2019;t conceal the general squalor. The hallstand was heaped high with clothes, including a musquash winter coat to feed the moths. The lino of the small area of floor that could be seen was an indistinct grey colour. Natasha&#x2019;s hostess must have been planning her cleaning session for a long time.<br><br>&#x2018;Your name&#x2019;s Natasha, isn&#x2019;t it, my daughter? Mine&#x2019;s Dasha.&#x2019;<br><br>Dasha was fifteen or twenty years older than her. At least. She could have been Natasha&#x2019;s mother, but with a mother like that you&#x2019;d want to hang yourself . . . A pudgy figure, with dirty, dull hair and bright nail varnish peeling from her fingernails, wearing a washed-out house coat and crumbling slippers on her bare feet. Her toenails glittered with nail varnish too. God, how vulgar!<br><br>&#x2018;Are you a seer?&#x2019; Natasha asked. And in her own mind she cried: &#x2018;What a fool I am.&#x2019;<br><br>Dasha nodded. She bent down and extracted a pair of rubber slippers from a tangled heap of footwear. The most idiotic kind of slippers ever invented &#x2014; with all those rubber prongs sticking out on the inside. A Yogi&#x2019;s dream. Some of them had fallen off long before, but that didn&#x2019;t make the slippers look any more comfortable.<br><br>&#x2018;Put them on!&#x2019; Dasha suggested joyfully.<br><br>As if hypnotised, Natasha took off her sandals and put on the slippers. Goodbye, tights. She was bound to end up with a couple of ladders. Even in her famous Omsa tights with their famous Lycra. Everything in this world was a swindle invented by cunning fools. And for some reason intelligent people always fell for it.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, I&#x2019;m a seer,&#x2019; Dasha declared as she attentively supervised the donning of the slippers. &#x2018;I got it from my grandma. And my mum too. They were all seers, they all helped people, it runs in our family . . . Come through into the kitchen, Natasha, I haven&#x2019;t tidied up the rooms yet . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Still cursing herself for being so stupid, Natasha went into the kitchen, which fulfilled all her expectations. A heap of dirty dishes in the sink and a filthy table &#x2014; as they appeared, a cockroach crawled lazily off the table-top and round under it. A sticky floor. The windows had obviously not been spring-cleaned and the ceiling was fly-spotted.<br><br>&#x2018;Sit down.&#x2019; Dasha deftly pulled out a stool from under the table and moved it over to the place of honour &#x2014; between the table and the fridge, a convulsively twitching Saratov.<br><br>&#x2018;Thank you, I&#x2019;ll stand.&#x2019; Natasha had made her mind up defin�itely not to sit down. The stool inspired even less confidence than the table or the floor. &#x2018;Dasha . . . That&#x2019;s Darya?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, Darya.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Darya, I really only wanted to find out . . .&#x2019;<br><br>The woman shrugged. She flicked the switch on the electric kettle &#x2014; probably the only object in the kitchen that didn&#x2019;t look as if it had been retrieved from a rubbish tip. She looked at Natasha.<br><br>&#x2018;Find out? There&#x2019;s nothing to find out. Everything&#x2019;s just as clear as can be.&#x2019;<br><br>For a moment Natasha had an unpleasant, oppressive sensation, as if there wasn&#x2019;t enough light in the kitchen. Everything went grey, the agonised rumbling of the refrigerator and the traffic outside on the avenue fell silent. She wiped the icy perspiration from her forehead. It was the heat. The summer, the heat, the long journey in the metro, the crush in the trolleybus . . . Why hadn&#x2019;t she taken a taxi? She&#x2019;d sent away the driver with the car &#x2014; well, she&#x2019;d been embarrassed to give anyone even a hint of where she was going and why . . . but why hadn&#x2019;t she taken a taxi?</p><h2>Foundations and Best Practices in Early Childhood Education: History, Theories, and Approaches to Learning</h2><p><b>A broad exploration of the roles and practices of working with, and for, children and families </b> <br> <i> <b>Foundations and Best Practices in Early Childhood Education</b> </i> helps teachers connect early childhood education beliefs and philosophies to professional practice.

Its Syntax and Semantics (Studies in Logic)</h2><p>The Lambda Calculus, treated in this book mainly in its untyped version, consists of a collection of expressions, called lambda terms, together with ways how to rewrite and identify these. In the parts conversion, reduction, theories, and models the view is respectively &#39;algebraic&#39;, computational, with more (&#39;coinductive&#39;) identifications, and finally set-theoretic. The lambda terms are built up from variables, using application and abstraction. Applying a term F to M has as intention that F is a function, M its argument, and FM the result of the application. This is only the intention: to actually obtain the result one has to rewrite the expression FM according to the reduction rules. Abstraction provides a way to create functions according to the effect when applying them. The power of the theory comes from the fact that computations, both terminating and infinite, can be expressed by lambda terms at a &#39;comfortable&#39; level of abstraction.</p><p></p><h2>Practical C++ Programming, Second Edition</h2><p><p>C++ is a powerful, highly flexible, and adaptable programming language that allows software engineers to organize and process information quickly and effectively. But this high-level language is relatively difficult to master, even if you already know the C programming language.The 2nd edition of <i>Practical C++ Programming</i> is a complete introduction to the C++ language for programmers who are learning C++. Reflecting the latest changes to the C++ standard, this 2nd edition takes a useful down-to-earth approach, placing a strong emphasis on how to design clean, elegant code.In short, to-the-point chapters, all aspects of programming are covered including style, software engineering, programming design, object-oriented design, and debugging. It also covers common mistakes and how to find (and avoid) them. End of chapter exercises help you ensure you've mastered the material.Practical C++ Programming thoroughly covers:</p><ul><li>C++ Syntax</li><li>Coding standards and style</li><li>Creation and use of object classes</li><li>Templates</li><li>Debugging and optimization</li><li>Use of the C++ preprocessor</li><li>File input/output</li></ul>Steve Oualline's clear, easy-going writing style and hands-on approach to learning make <i>Practical C++ Programming</i> a nearly painless way to master this complex but powerful programming language.</p><p><p>Steve Oualline lives in Southern California, where he works as a software engineer for a major phone company. In his free time he is a real engineer on the Poway Midland Railroad. Steve has written almost a dozen books on programming and Linux software. His web site is http://www.oualline.com .</p>&#34;When I picked up Practical C++ I was very skeptical, I&#39;ve read numerous books aimed at beginner/intermediate readers and very few of them left any lasting impression on me. This book however, did! It&#39;s an excellent book, and it feels like it&#39;s written by a programmer and not an academic as most tend to. Not only are you going to learn about C++ in the easiest way possible, you&#39;re going to learn a lot of tips from someone who&#39;s been developing in C++ a long time. ... But I can&#39;t say enough good things about this book, it covers a lot more than C++, and it has a whole chapter on program design. This book is all you need to get started with C++. The title says Practical C++ and I&#39;d say it&#39;s very practical. Highly recommended.&#34; - Peter Waller, news@UK</p><h2>Why Old Places Matter: How Historic Places Affect Our Identity and Well-Being (American Association for State and Local History)</h2><p><br>Why Old Places Matter is the only book that explores the reasons that old places matter to people. Although people often feel very deeply about the old places of their lives, they don&#x2019;t have the words to express why. This book brings these ideas together in evocative language and with illustrative images for a broad audience.<br><br>The book reveals the fundamentally important yet under-recognized role old places play in our lives. While many people feel a deep-seated connection to old places -- from those who love old houses, to the millions of tourists who are drawn to historic cities, to the pilgrims who flock to ancient sites throughout the world -- few can articulate why. The book explores these deep attachments people have with old places &#x2013;the feelings of belonging, continuity, stability, identity and memory, as well as the more traditional reasons that old places have been deemed by society to be important, such as history, national identity, and architecture.<br><br>This book will be appealing to anyone who has ever loved an old place. But more importantly, it will be an useful resource to articulate why old places are meaningful to people and their communities. This book will help people understand that the feeling many have for old places is supported by a wide variety of fields, and that the continued existence of these old places is good. It will give people the words and phrases to understand and express why old places matter.</p><p>Thompson McCord Mayes, vice president and senior counsel at the National Trust for Historic Preservation, has spent his professional career preserving old places. In 2013, Tom was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Rome Prize in Historic Preservation by the American Academy in Rome, and subsequently spent a six-month residency in Rome as a Fellow of the Academy. The essays that are collected in this publication came about as a result of that experience. They were previously published in 2014 and 2015 as a series on the National Trust&#x2019;s Preservation Leadership Forum Blog, http://blog.preservation leadershipforum.org.Thompson Mayes presents the case for being loyal to places we love. Actually, he makes the case for falling in love and remaining true through a series of thoughtful and stimulating essays. Rome is Mayes&#x2019; muse. One of the world&#x2019;s oldest and most significant cities, Rome provides the inspiration for his clarion call for preservation. The interdisciplinary community of the American Academy in Rome, where Mayes was a Fellow, enriches his deep grounding in the historic preservation institutions built heritage of the United States. Mayes&#x2019; essays are lively and full of insight and hope. Why Old Places Matter is essential reading for anyone engaged in the design or planning of the built environment. (Frederick Steiner, Dean and Paley Professor, Co-Director, The Ian L. McHarg Center: Urbanism + Ecology, University of Pennsylvania)<br><br>Mayes has framed the context of historic preservation for the next generation. Whether you&#x2019;re a student, an activist, a professional in the field, or just care about your community, there is no better way to understand the &#x2018;why&#x2019; of historic preservation than by reading this superb book. (Donovan D. Rypkema, President, Heritage Strategies International)<br><br>[Mayes] has summarized his years of work &#x2013; and six months in Rome &#x2013; devoted to answering that most basic question about the importance of places commonly perceived as &#x2018;old.&#x2019; The book is a great read for built environment professionals, elected officials, and others who work with urban issues. . . . He tells stories of continuity of building use, and changed attitudes about Confederate statues, including those in his own hometown. On a practical level, Mayes equates &#x201c;old places&#x201d; with today&#x2019;s fascination with DNA tests, and ancestry websites . . . what I like best is the author&#x2019;s voice as a fireside storyteller, providing accessibility to otherwise heady concepts. (<i>Planetizen</i>)</p><h2>Hegel&#39;s Idealism: The Satisfactions of Self-Consciousness</h2><p>This is the most important book on Hegel to have appeared in the past ten years. The author offers a completely new interpretation of Hegel&#39;s idealism that focuses on Hegel&#39;s appropriation and development of Kant&#39;s theoretical project. Hegel is presented neither as a pre-critical metaphysician nor as a social theorist, but as a critical philosopher whose disagreements with Kant, especially on the issue of intuitions, enrich the idealist arguments against empiricism, realism, and naturalism. In the face of the dismissal of absolute idealism as either unintelligible or implausible, Pippin explains and defends an original account of the philosophical basis for Hegel&#39;s claims about the historical and social nature of self-consciousness and of knowledge itself.</p><p>Hegel is presented as a critical philosopher whose disagreements with Kant only enhance the idealist arguments against empiricism, realism and naturalism in this original interpretation.Robert B. Pippin is the Evelyn Stefansson Nef Distinguished Service Professor in the Committee on Social Thought, the Department of Philosophy, and the College at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>First Amendment Law: Freedom of Expression and Freedom of Religion</h2><p><p>This book reflects a basic truth: First Amendment law is caselaw. It thus edits cases lightly, and presents them in the Court's own doctrinal structure, in order to reinforce the student's learning of the law as the Court actually developed it. Notes and questions provide guidance in working with the opinions. Non-case materials (including drafts and memoranda from the Justices' private papers) are used to shed light on what was established by existing precedents and how a new decision changes (or does not change) the law. By giving primacy to the Justice' won words and the Court's own doctrinal structure, the book offers maximum flexibility for teachers to place their own imprint on the course.</p><p>New features in the Fourth Edition include:</p><p>A reorganized chapter order reflecting the Court's increased focus on the content-based/content-neutral distinction; A new, freestanding campaign finance chapter; An expanded treatment of the history and values of the Religion Clauses; and New problems based on recent appellate cases and news stories. It also features a detailed Teacher's Manual offering comprehensive instructional guidance including references to online resources.</p></p><p>Arthur D.

Elder provides school administrators with a simple method, called Exit Counseling, to rid their schools of mediocre, marginal, and incompetent teachers. He teaches principals how to build a case and document it so tightly that virtually any union challenge will fail. His theory is simple straightforward, clear, and concise.<br><br>Elder watched and learned a lot about teacher dismissal over the 32 years he spent as an education association UniServ Director in Maryland and Delaware. Having "worked the other side", he shares the techniques, tips, and even the traps he learned and used over the years. He has interacted with hundreds of administrators and teachers, he knows both sides' vulnerable spots, and in <i>Dismissal Doesn't Have to be Difficult</i>, he shares that knowledge.<br><br>In case format, Elder uses his "war stories" to illustrate and confront school reform, incompetence, insubordination, negligence, union secret weapons and tactics, grievance avoidance, and bouncing lemons.

Tyler suggests that lawmakers and law enforcers would do much better to make legal systems worthy of respect than to try to instill fear of punishment. He finds that people obey law primarily because they believe in respecting legitimate authority.</p><p> In his fascinating new afterword, Tyler brings his book up to date by reporting on new research into the relative importance of legal legitimacy and deterrence, and reflects on changes in his own thinking since his book was first published.</p></p><p><b>Tom R.

David Kirby here sets out the fascinating history of this northern country, for centuries on the east-west divide of Europe, a country not blessed by nature, most of whose inhabitants still earned a living from farming fifty years ago, but which today is one of the most prosperous members of the European Union. He shows how this small country was able not only to survive in peace and war but also to preserve and develop its own highly distinctive identity, neither Scandinavian nor Eastern European. He traces the evolution of the idea of a Finnish national state, from the long centuries as part of the Swedish realm, through self-government within the Russian Empire, and into the stormy and tragic birth of the independent state in the twentieth century.</p><p>An up-to-date political, social and economic history of Finland from medieval times to the present.

Does morality become more permissive in a state of war? Jeff McMahan argues that conditions in war make no difference to what morality permits and the justifications for killing people are the same in war as they are in other contexts, such as individual self-defence. This view is radically at odds with the traditional theory of the just war and has implications that challenge common sense views. McMahan argues, for example, that it is wrong to fight in a war that is unjust because it lacks a just cause.</p><p><br><strong>Jeff McMahan</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Rutgers University. He works primarily in ethics and political philosophy, and occasionally in metaphysics and legal theory.<br>Review from previous edition: "In this densely argued and superbly written volume, Jeff McMahan provides a comprehensive defence of the claim that moral liability to attack in war follows from responsibility for the threat of harm posed by a war fought without a just cause... McMahan's thesis<br>conflicts with numerous principles central to the currently dominant, though increasingly contested, understanding of just war theory... The comprehensive nature of McMahans discussion... makes clear why those concerned with the morality of killing in war must engage with it. Indeed, I believe that<br>Killing in War ought to replace Michael Walzers venerable Just and Unjust Wars as the text around which practitioners and theorists alike construct debates over the ethics of waging war."<br><br>--David Leftowitz, Transnational Legal Theory<br><br>"McMahan's challenge to Just War theory in this gracefully written and challenging presentation is extremely important and deserves close attention... [He] performs an extremely important service in...providing us with a sophisticated and original contribution to the debate. This book will be<br>widely read and debated and deservedly so; anyone working on these topics will have to grapple with McMahan's subtle and important analysis of the issues."<br><br>--Whitley Kaufman, Ethics 07/05/2010<br><br>"Killing in War is the high-water mark of just war theory since Just and Unjust Wars."<br><br>--Seth Lazar, Philosophy and Public Affairs 27/04/2010<br><br>"McMahan argues... that there is something terribly wrong with just war theory... By the end of the book, many readers will wonder how anyone could feel otherwise... McMahan develops [his] view with uncommon thoroughness, setting out numerous objections, and presents replies with the<br>comprehensive efficiency of a medieval summa."<br><br>--Douglas Lackey, Journal of Applied Philosophy 19/04/2010<br><br>"Jeff McMahan has written an important, highly intelligent book... [It is] densely packed with intricate argument, well-informed, carefully written, and full of insight, scholarship, and tough argument."<br><br>--C. A. J. Coady, Australian Book Review 19/04/2010<br><br>"McMahan's book is a great achievement. His writing is lucid and the book stands as the most comprehensive and sophisticated criticism to date of both the idea of 'moral equality' of combatants and that civilians and soldiers can delegate their moral responsibility for the waging of an unjust<br>war to their government."<br><br>--Uwe Steinhoff, Cambridge Review of International Affairs 08/10/2009<br><br>"[It is] a commonplace in modern thinking about political obedience and participation in war [that] soldiers aren't responsible for the wars their leaders initiate - however wrongly - and that if they fight in an unjust war, they are free from blame so long as they do so humanely, respecting<br>the rules of discrimination and proportionality. Jeff McMahan's eloquent and rigorously argued book launches a devastating attack on this belief, showing why it cannot be sustained in international law or in the theory of the just war that supports it. As a challenge to the received wisdom, the<br>significance of McMahan's central claim cannot be overstressed."<br><br>--Christopher Finlay, Political Quarterly 17/02/2010<br><br>"I found this work so convincing that it is difficult to raise many criticisms... Killing in War represents a tremendous achievement from one of today's leading moral philosophers. Never before has a book so swiftly challenged my own views and convinced me that I was in error. I cannot<br>recommend it highly enough."<br><br>--Thom Brooks, Times Higher Education Supplement 08/10/2009<br><br>"Ultimately, as McMahan expertly demonstrates, there is really nothing - not institutional command, procedural guarantees, the 'special' nature of war itself, the description of combat - that adequately and cleanly differentiates war from non-war. This being so, we need to radically rethink<br>the way we justfy war, the way we fight in war and the agency of the combatants we get to do our fighting for us... McMahan's book urgently needs to be read not only by combatants, to whom McMahan restores a real and profound sense of moral agency and autonomy, but by anyone who has voted for,<br>backed, or declared war of any kind... McMahon's book offers some fine, clear answers"<br><br>--Nina Power, The Philosophers Magazine 23/11/2009<br><br>"Jeff McMahan has written a genuinely revolutionary book... Once advanced, McMahan's thesis seems obvious, and it is his considerable philosophical merit to make us realize how obvious it is... McMahan is a very careful philosopher; as soon as he states a thesis, he thinks of qualifications,<br>objections, and rebuttals... He does not operate from a general theory but proceeds from case to case, weaving an intricate web of subtle distinctions Killing in War is a distinguished contribution to moral theory."<br><br>--David Gordon, The Mises Review 15/06/2009</p><h2>Thinking Qualitatively: Methods of Mind</h2><p><p>Written in Johnny Salda�a&#x2032;s elegant and accessible style, <strong>Thinking Qualitatively: Methods of Mind</strong> boldly pursues the challenge of teaching students not just how to collect and analyze data, but how to actively <em>think</em> about them. Each chapter presents one "method of mind" (thinking analytically, realistically, symbolically, ethically, multidisciplinarily, artistically, summarily, interpretively, and narratively), together with applications, a vignette or story related to the thinking modality, points to remember, and exercises. Designed to help researchers "rise above the data," the book explores how qualitative research designs, data collection, data analyses, and write-ups can be enriched through over 60 different lenses, filters, and angles on social life. Venturing into more evocative and multidimensional ways to examine the complex patterns of daily living, the book reveals how the researcher&#x2032;s mind thinks heuristically to transcend the descriptive and develop "highdeep" insights about the human condition.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>"This is a book for all qualitative methodologists.

Attacking the universally accepted psychiatric doctrines that blur the distinction between literal and metaphoric diseases, Szasz argues that insanity is not an objectively definable or identifiable condition and presents a more fully-rounded account of the insanity concept, showing how it relates to and differs from three closely allied ideas--social deviance, bodily illness and the sick role. Reveals why it is truly impossible to understand psychiatric problems without first distinguishing an abnormal biological condition--like diabetes--from the sick role. Destined to become a classic, this is an important addition to the author&#39;s already impressive body of work.</p><p>In this book, Dr. Szasz challenges the way both science and society define insanity; in the process, he helps us better understand this often misunderstood condition.Szasz is the well-known anti-psychiatric psychiatrist who first attacked the "myth of mental illness" 25 years ago. Several books since, including the present one, seem redundantly to echo his attack. Always a clear and accessible writer, the author has some trenchant criticisms of psychobiology, of a society perhaps too ready to excuse criminality as psychopathology, of a field filled with jargon (is "self-actualization" anything more than "living life to its fullest"?). Unfortunately, such refreshing insights are buried in the overall excess of a polemic dismissing virtually all inner mental life and conflict in favor of a vague, apparently concretistic viewpoint. The book is certainly acessible to the lay public but not much of an addition to the author's previous work.

That is now uncontroversial to the point of triviality--of course, policy should be based on the facts. But are the methods that policy makers rely on to gather and analyze evidence the right ones? In <em>Evidence-Based Policy</em>, Nancy Cartwright, an eminent scholar, and Jeremy Hardie, who has had a long and successful career in both business and the economy, explain that the dominant methods which are in use now--broadly speaking, methods that imitate standard practices in medicine like randomized control trials--do not work. They fail, Cartwright and Hardie contend, because they do not enhance our ability to predict if policies will be effective.<br><br>The prevailing methods fall short not just because social science, which operates within the domain of real-world politics and deals with people, differs so much from the natural science milieu of the lab. Rather, there are principled reasons why the advice for crafting and implementing policy now on offer will lead to bad results. Current guides in use tend to rank scientific methods according to the degree of trustworthiness of the evidence they produce. That is valuable in certain respects, but such approaches offer little advice about how to think about putting such evidence to use. <em>Evidence-Based Policy</em> focuses on showing policymakers how to effectively use evidence, explaining what types of information are most necessary for making reliable policy, and offers lessons on how to organize that information.</p><p><br><strong>Nancy Cartwright</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at UC-San Diego and London School of Economics.<br><strong>Jeremy Hardie</strong> is an Honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford and a Fellow of King's College London; he is also Vice President of the Royal Economic Society, and was Chairman of the WH Smith Group from 1992 to 2010.<br><br>"Nancy Cartwright and Jeremy Hardie are to be complimented. In their new book, <em>Evidence-Based Policy</em>, the authors have attempted to address a serious problem in policy design... In the process, they do a number of things very well, including debunking the notion that randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for solving all problems in all situations...

Their belief inspired a three hour interview where Dan candidly shared his personal journey that has included a wide range of ministry experiences. With honesty and humility they discussed: - God&#39;s calls to ordinary people to do extraordinary things - Miraculous stories, divine encounters and supernatural manifestations - The place for God-called apostles and prophets in the Holiness movement - The ministries of healing and impartation - Hindrances to revival and how to sustain a kingdom culture This book will inspire you and challenge your traditional thinking with profound biblical insights, and hopefully cause you to live and teach a message of holiness and healing. Dan Bohi is an itinerant minister with a mission to awaken the Church of Jesus Christ to the power, purity, and freedom of the Spirit-filled life found, realized, experienced and exhibited in the lives of believers in the book of Acts. Dan and Debbie have four married children and thirteen grandchildren. Rob McCorkle is the Founder of Fire School Ministries whose mission is to redig the wells in the Holiness movement by reawakening the message of purity and power. Along with pastoring in Columbus, Ohio, he travels speaking in churches and conferences. Rob and Cindy have two married children and two grandchildren.</p><p></p><h2>The Penguin Atlas of African History: Revised Edition</h2><p>This invaluable reference work provides an account of the development of African society from 175 million years ago, through the first appearance of humans to the complex polity of the twentieth century.

Kingdoms and Empires are only part of the story. The atlas covers the development of modern man, the differentiation and spread of African languages, the first crossings of the Sahara, the exploration of the Niger, and the search for &#39;the fountains of the Nile&#39;. Gold and ivory lure traders from far away; Christendom and Islam compete for African attention. Names from the distant past become nation-states with aspirations appropriate to the modern world. Using the formula successfully established in his previous historical atlases, Colin McEvedy outlines this progress with the aid of sixty maps and a clear, concise text.

Sociology professor and spiritual director Susan Phillips walks us through the "circus" of our cultural landscape to invite us into a cultivated life of spirituality. If we want to accept the invitation to return to the garden, then we must face down the temptation to live life as spectators of the circus that plays on around us. We want to be rooted and grounded in Christ, but are pushed toward constant work, alternating between performance and spectacle. Cultivation requires a kind of attentiveness that is countercultural to our age of distraction. These pages unfold the spiritual practices that can lead us into a new and delightful way of living. Are you ready to leave the circus?</p><p>Susan S. Phillips (PhD, University of California, Berkeley) is executive director and professor of sociology and Christianity at New College Berkeley. She is a sociologist and trained spiritual director. Phillips is the author of several books, including <em>Candlelight: Illuminating the Art of Spiritual Direction</em>. In addition to lecturing internationally and leading retreats for churches and organizations, Phillips also teaches at Regent College in Vancouver, Canada, and Fuller Theological Seminary.<br><br>Peterson, now retired, was for many years James M. Houston Professor of Spiritual Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. He also served as founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland. In addition to his widely acclaimed paraphrase of the Bible, <em>The Message</em> (NavPress), he has written many other books."The book is a helpful resource for an adult education class. The appendix, in particular, is a hands-on resource for the how-to of developing these navigational tools. I could see this book being used at my own church in an eight-week study on Christian practices with the goal of helping folks in my community navigate their way into the garden while living in the circus. Thank you, Susan Phillips, for such a practical and fresh look at ancient practices." (Emily Berman D'Andrea, The Presbyterian Outlook, August 31, 2015)<br><br>"Susan Phillips, a noted sociologist, not only challenges us to 'leave the circus' of fast-paced mainstream culture, she offers a compelling vision of how we can begin to embody the rich joy and attentiveness of Jesus." (Relevant Magazine, July/August 2015)<br><br>"Phillips' academic exploration of cultivating Christian spirituality is told through great stories and vivid word pictures of life in a circus versus a garden atmosphere. She concludes each chapter with a reflective study and provides extensive guidelines for practicing contemplative living, Sabbath living, lectio divina, finding a spiritual director, and cultivating friendship." (Donna Watson, CBA Retailers + Resources, July 2015)<br><br>"We all struggle in the circuslike culture of contemporary society, which often causes difficulties in attention and healthy attachment in the midst of yearning for the spiritual life. Susan Phillips provides us with ways to cultivate the contemplative life by examining spiritual practices within the Christian tradition such as spiritual direction, <em>lectio divina</em>, listening and friendship. I believe the author's use of stories&#x2015; stories that have emerged from her practice of attentive listening&#x2015;will affect readers deeply." (Jung Eun Sophia Park, assistant professor of religious studies and philosophy, Holy Names University)<br><br>"Susan Phillips's <em>The Cultivated Life</em> is a remarkable work on so many levels. Her insightful and sophisticated analysis is able to synthesize both the theoretical and practical in profound and compelling ways. Her skills as a creative theologian and biblical interpreter, a wise and insightful spiritual director, and one grounded in the common-sense particularities and complexities of human experience and history makes her work an extraordinary contribution in so many arenas of pastoral and theological practice. The breadth of her sources and insights&#x2015;from literature, psychology, philosophy, theology, ecumenical and religious history, and personal history, among others&#x2015;make this a must-read for scholars, students and practitioners alike. Phillips's style is accessible, engaging and invitational. . . . I recommend Susan Phillips's book with great enthusiasm for all audiences&#x2015;for all who are searching." (James A. Donahue, president, Saint Mary's College of California)<br><br>"<em>The Cultivated Life</em> reads like the cool evening breeze at the end of a blazing hot day in the desert. . . . It is also a prophetic clarion call&#x2015;a warning to a generation trapped in the meaningless rat-race of twenty-first-century existence, suffocated by the demands of addictive consumerism, obsessed with the lifeless toys of modernity, while the breath of heaven who is only a prayer away eagerly waits to share with us the real joys of living. This book is a timely gift to the community of faith to be treasured and shared. More than that, this is essential survival reading for every true pilgrim seeking after the pearl of great price." (Ivan Satyavrata, senior pastor, Assembly of God Church, Kolkata, India)<br><br>"<em>The Cultivated Life</em> is filled with gifts of a generous, transparent spirit. Reading this insightful book and reflecting on its profound questions invite us to taste the life Susan Phillips lives. . . . When I reached the end of <em>The Cultivated Life</em> I returned to the beginning to soak in the words, insights and prayers that arose. Thank you, Susan, for giving us a glimpse of wholeness by offering gifts of spiritual direction through your writing." (Jeannette A. Bakke, author of Holy Invitations)<br><br>"Susan Phillips tells great stories and uses vivid word pictures. Her contrast between circus and garden reveals deep truths about the overstimulation in our daily lives and Jesus' invitation to cultivate a restful and focused life rooted in him. Cultivation implies habits and discipline, and Susan winsomely invites us into new patterns of living. A garden implies lush green leaves and fruitful bounty, and Susan guides our paths into joy and rest. Come into the garden with Jesus and journey into abundant life." (Lynne M. Baab, author of The Power of Listening and Sabbath Keeping)<br><br>"The most basic human question in daily living is not so much 'what?' but 'how?' Just check the magazine covers in the check-out line. Articles promise to tell us how to lose weight, how to get rich, how to be sexy. But what if you've lived enough to know that life is about more than health, wealth and a good time? This is a book for people who are interested in the how of a life that's really life. Would that it could be front-and-center in every check-out line." (Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, author of Strangers at My Door)<br><br>"Susan Phillips can write this book because she lives it. For three decades and more, I have observed the choices she makes to cultivate life and this has been the hallmark of her story. This book is a deep and magnanimous invitation to live in such a way that the flourishing for which we are made can become our experience. Let the grounded welcome she extends and encourages lead us through the circus towards life itself."

Everyone has friends beyond the veil, as author Christopher Penczak explains, &#34;A spirit ally is a being in the unseen realms who, for whatever reason, decides to aid, befriend, protect, or teach us while we live our own Earthwalk.&#34; He dispels the shadowy ambiguity and fear surrounding the existence of these spiritual entities, shares compelling personal anecdotes, and offers straightforward techniques--such as relaxation, automatic writing, and oracle interpretation--to help readers contact their own guides. Through 30 simple exercises, Spirit Allies helps readers find their Power Animal, dream journey, speak with devas, communicate with ancestors and ascended masters, meet their personal spirit allies, and much more.</p><p>Christopher Penczak (New Hampshire) is an award-winning author, teacher, healing practitioner, and eclectic Witch. His practice draws upon the foundation of modern Witchcraft blended with the wisdom of mystical traditions from across the globe. He has studied extensively with renowned Witch Laurie Cabot and other Witches, shamans, yogis, and healers in the New England area which have influenced his eclectic path of personal Witchcraft. Penczak is an ordained minister of the Universal Brotherhood Movement, is a certified flower essence consultant, and is a certified Reiki Master (Teacher) in the UsuiTibetan and Shamballa traditions. A popular public speaker, he tours extensively throughout the year at bookstores and major gatherings. Penczak is the author of City Magick (Red Wheel;Weiser), Spirit Allies (Red Wheel;Weiser), and Gay Witchcraft (Red Wheel;Weiser&#39;nominated for a Lambda Award). A columnist for newWitch magazine, his work has also been featured in publications such as Genre, InnerSelf Magazine and Kaleidoscope, and his writing appears in the recent book I Do, I Don&#39;t: Queers on Marriage. Penczak is a faculty member at the North Eastern Institute of Whole Health and a founding member of the Gifts of Grace Foundation, a nonprofit organization in New Hampshire made up of individuals from diverse spiritual backgrounds dedicated to service to the local communities."Interfacing with the spirit world is fairly easy.... The lands beyond the veil are part and parcel of our nature," says Penczak (City Magick). Here he makes a convincing case for such a world, detailing a multitude of ways not only to contact, but also to communicate with the entities who inhabit it. He gently argues that the spiritual dimension (heaven and hell in the most simplified forms) perennially exists in every culture, and that we, too, are spiritual beings. ("If our spirits are here, there are many other spirits, in other realms, experiencing other things.") Penczak leaves no spirit untouched: angels, ascended masters, deities, ancestors, soul groups, power animals, elementals, devas, constructs and ghosts can be contacted by such means as ritual, channeling, shape-shifting, riding (as in Voodoo) and walking in, to name but a few. Penczak wisely does not throw the door open to any and all such spiritual entities. He repeatedly provides checkpoints and signposts to discern which spirits are interested in one's higher good, and he emphatically rejects abdicating one's spiritual authority in any case. It would be hard to imagine a more complete guide for getting to know such companions who want to help, befriend or teach us. Numerous exercises, primarily forms of meditation, visualization and ritual, make this a very practical manual. This work can benefit those of any faith who can comfortably trust that divine aid may come in many forms.

And there is one part of the diagnosis that no one will discuss with her: what it means to be a young girl with cancer in a beauty-obsessed culture. Trying to find herself, while losing her vibrancy and her looks, Geralyn embarks on a road to self-acceptance that will inspire all women. Although her book is explicitly about a period of time where she was driven by fear and uncertainty about the future, Geralyn managed a transformation that will encourage all women under siege to discover their own courage and beauty.

The novel details the lives of two childhood friends, Clare Kendry and Irene Redfield, both of whom are of mixed African and European ancestry and are &#x201c;passing&#x201d; as whites. The novel picks up in the lives of the two as they later reunite in adulthood. An ambiguous relation develops between the two as they share a fascination for how each other&#x2019;s lives have transpired since they last knew each other. Larsen&#x2019;s work has been lauded for its exploration of race, gender, class, and sexuality amongst African Americans in early part of the 20th century. Now considered as a major figure of the Harlem Renaissance, Larsen&#x2019;s writing gives a firsthand insight into the struggle of African Americans during this era. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p><p>The heroine of <i>Passing</i> takes an elevator from the infernal August Chicago streets to the breezy rooftop of the heavenly Drayton Hotel, "wafted upward on a magic carpet to another world, pleasant, quiet, and strangely remote from the sizzling one that she had left below." Irene is black, but like her author, the Danish-African American Nella Larsen (a star of the 1920s to mid-1930s Harlem Renaissance and the first black woman to win a Guggenheim creative-writing award), she can "pass" in white society. Yet one woman in the tea room, "fair and golden, like a sunlit day," keeps staring at her, and eventually introduces herself as Irene's childhood friend Clare, who left their hometown 12 years before when her father died. Clare's father had been born "on the left hand"--he was the product of a legal marriage between a white man and a black woman and therefore cut off from his inheritance. So she was raised penniless by white racist relatives, and now she passes as white. Even Clare's violent white husband is in the dark about her past, though he teases her about her tan and affectionately calls her "Nig." He laughingly explains: "When we were first married, she was white as--as--well as white as a lily. But I declare she's getting darker and darker." As Larsen makes clear, <i>Passing</i> can also mean dying, and Clare is in peril of losing her identity and her life.<p> The tale is simple on the surface--a few adventures in Chicago and New York's high life, with lots of real people and race-mixing events described (explicated by Thadious M. Davis's helpful introduction and footnotes). But underneath, it seethes with rage, guilt, sex, and complex deceptions. Irene fears losing her black husband to Clare, who seems increasingly predatory. Or is this all in Irene's mind? And is everyone wearing a mask? Larsen's book is a scary hall of mirrors, a murder mystery that can't resolve itself. It sticks with you. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>First published to critical acclaim in 1929, Passing firmly established Nella Larsen's prominence among women writers of the Harlem Renaissance. The Modern Library is proud to present Passing?an electrifying story of two women who cross the color line in 1920s New York?together with a new Introduction by the Obie Award- winning playwright and novelist Ntozake Shange.<br><br>Irene Redfield, the novel's protagonist, is a woman with an enviable life. She and her husband, Brian, a prominent physician, share a comfortable Harlem town house with their sons. Her work arranging charity balls that gather Harlem's elite creates a sense of purpose and respectability for Irene. But her hold on this world begins to slip the day she encounters Clare Kendry, a childhood friend with whom she had lost touch. Clare?light-skinned, beautiful, and charming?tells Irene how, after her father's death, she left behind the black neighborhood of her adolescence and began passing for white, hiding her true identity from everyone, including her racist husband. As Clare begins inserting herself into Irene's life, Irene is thrown into a panic, terrified of the consequences of Clare's dangerous behavior. And when Clare witnesses the vibrancy and energy of the community she left behind, her burning desire to come back threatens to shatter her careful deception.<br><br>Brilliantly plotted and elegantly written, Passing offers a gripping psychological portrait of emotional extremity. The New York Times Book Review called Larsen "adroit at tracing the involved processes of a mind divided against itself, that fights between the dictates of reason and desire." The Saturday Review of Literature said, "[Larsen] has produced a work so fine, sensitive, and distinguished that it rises above race categories and becomes that rare object, a good novel."<br></p><h2>Goodnight Moon</h2><p>children</p><p>Perhaps the perfect children's bedtime book, <i>Goodnight Moon</i> is a short poem of goodnight wishes from a young rabbit preparing for--or attempting to postpone--his own slumber. He says goodnight to every object in sight and within earshot, including the "quiet old lady whispering hush." Clement Hurd's illustrations are simple and effective, alternating between small ink drawings and wide, brightly colored views of the little rabbit's room. <p> Finding all of the items mentioned throughout the book within the pictures is a good bedtime activity--a reappearing little mouse is particularly pesky. By the end of the little rabbit's goodnight poem, the story has quieted to a whisper, and the drawings have darkened with nightfall. As you turn the last page, you can expect a sleepy smile and at least a yawn or two. (Picture book)</p><p>In a great green room, tucked away in bed, is a little bunny. "Goodnight room, goodnight moon." And to all the familiar things in the softly lit room -- to the picture of the three little bears sitting on chairs, to the clocks and his socks, to themittens and the kittens, toeverything one by one -- the little bunny says goodnight.</p> <p>In this classic of children's literature, beloved by generations of readers and listeners, the quiet poetry of the words and the gentle, lulling illustrations combine to make a perfect book for the end of the day.</p></p><h2>The Bone Doll&#39;s Twin (Tamir Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p>Sometimes the price of destiny is higher than anyone imagined....<br><br><b>Dark Magic, Hidden Destiny<br></b><br>For three centuries a divine prophecy and a line of warrior queens protected Skala.

I didn&#x2019;t think my fingers were dirty, but I usually had ink on me somewhere.</p><p>I reached into the back of the old Subaru and pressed down on the &#x201c;L&#x201d; key, feeling no pressure and seeing no movement. &#x201c;It seems that the type bar has detached.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you fix that?&#x201d; Mirabelle said.</p><p>Mirabelle Montgomery was one of our more frequent customers. She&#x2019;d been one of my grandfather&#x2019;s very first customers when he opened his shop, The Rescued Word, almost fifty-five years earlier. Back then, she&#x2019;d been wildly independent, writing scandalous stories on her already-half-a-century-old and classic Underwood No. 5 typewriter that she sold to even more scandalous magazines; that is, when she wasn&#x2019;t carving powder on the slopes, taking on moguls and black diamonds like the fearless skier she&#x2019;d been.</p><p>Mirabelle and my grandfather had formed a fast friendship, and though he had also been a fearless and accomplished skier, he often stated that he&#x2019;d never been as good as Mirabelle. Chester, my grandfather&#x2019;s name and what he wanted everyone including his grandchildren and great-grandchild to call him, had started his career by fixing typewriters. Back in 1960 when he&#x2019;d just turned twenty-two and was already a father of two, he&#x2019;d known he had to find a way to earn an income, so he started a business. He had no idea that his skills would transform over the years and turn The Rescued Word into the rare and unusual business it had become. He&#x2019;d been able to keep up with the changing times fairly well&#x2014;in between the days spent on the slopes and along with his manual-typewriter repair skills, he&#x2019;d taught himself how to restore old books to their former glory. He&#x2019;d built his own printing press&#x2014;one that was a &#x201c;bona fide Gutenberg replica,&#x201d; or so he often said, after which he&#x2019;d add some official-sounding lingo, as if an esteemed organization had given him the replica stamp of approval. Somewhere along the way, I figured out that no official experts had given the press any sort of notice at all, but it truly was an amazing machine.</p><p>Chester could even repair ink pens, the kind people spent real money for, the kind that were sought out when someone felt like they wanted to write something important or insightful. When I&#x2019;d first started working with him at The Rescued Word, I&#x2019;d been most surprised by how many people loved their pens. I preferred the throwaway variety myself, and I certainly noticed Chester&#x2019;s looks of perplexed dismay when I pulled out my BIC or Paper Mate, though he never said a word. When he added the sale of fine paper and modern-day writing instruments to his offerings, he created a business that was truly built to last.</p><p>&#x201c;I can definitely fix that,&#x201d; I said to Mirabelle.</p><p>&#x201c;Any chance I could get it back tomorrow?&#x201d; Mirabelle said. &#x201c;I have a letter for my grandson Miles. Oh, and I&#x2019;ll need more of that blue paper too. I can get that today though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet. I&#x2019;ll get this back to you by tomorrow,&#x201d; I said. I could, but it would mean working a little late, which was not a problem when it came to doing something for Mirabelle. I had to finish some work on a book that was due in the morning, but the printer was ready to go and the type blocks were in place.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, thank you, dear,&#x201d; she said as she placed a crooked, wrinkled finger gently on the back paper table of the typewriter. &#x201c;This old thing is like a friend, a constant companion. I don&#x2019;t write stories anymore, but my grandbabies love receiving my typed letters. I would hate to disappoint Miles if my latest note wasn&#x2019;t sent in a timely manner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand. And fortunately, you&#x2019;re not the only one who loves these old machines.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No? Gosh, most of the time I feel like I&#x2019;m a dinosaur, a dying breed.&#x201d; She laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;Not even close, Mirabelle. Some still like to write on old typewriters, and some just like to have them on display, but in working order. Nope, you&#x2019;re not the only one. This is, by the way, a very happy thing for The Rescued Word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Business is good, then?&#x201d; she asked, her penciled-on eyebrows lifting above her thick glasses.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, fortunately we do a little more than fix typewriters, but, yes, business is good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s wonderful to hear. Chester and I talk about every manner of thing, but never business. I worry about all of you over here. Bygone Alley is such a wonderful place. I&#x2019;d hate to see anyone leave,&#x201d; Mirabelle said.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we all stay pretty busy,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The fairly level street that jutted off the steep slope of Main Street had long ago been affectionately named Bygone Alley for the old-time stores it held. Along with The Rescued Word, there was a yarn store with a couple looms, a beeswax candle store, a pocket-watch repair shop, a diner/cafe with a soda fountain, and the place where Professor Anorkory Levena taught Latin to people who actually paid him to learn the old, dead language. Though most of the services of those in Bygone Alley were from an earlier time and had been forgotten by many, all of us were still going strong, or strong enough.</p><p>I reached into the back of the Subaru and hefted out the almost ten pounds of Underwood. The No. 5s had at one time been the best of the best and used almost everywhere a typewriter was needed. They&#x2019;d been known for many things, but they&#x2019;d always been too big to lug around much, even if they had been called &#x201c;portable.&#x201d;</p><p>I knew that Mirabelle&#x2019;s decades-old Subaru had logged about seventy thousand miles, because other than a few times a year to Salt Lake City, she only drove to a couple nearby places. She lived around the corner from Bygone Alley, on the street than ran along the non&#x2013;Main Street side, and though the grocery store was at the bottom of a steep hill and around a tight S-turn, it was not far away. She&#x2019;d also spent forty-five years working at the Star City Bank and Trust, but she&#x2019;d walked to work every day. It had been an easy commute as she&#x2019;d gone to and from the bank&#x2019;s Main Street location via Bygone Alley, waving to us every morning or joining Chester for coffee if she had the time.</p><p>I supported the typewriter with both arms as Mirabelle closed the rear hatchback of the car, stepped up to the sidewalk, and opened the front door of The Rescued Word, signaling me to go in first.</p><p>When my grandfather purchased the two-story brick building, it had been empty for a few years, but before that it had been home to the Star City Silver Mining Company, a company that had flourished in the late 1800s and early 1900s because of the vast amounts of silver that had been found in the mountains around the mining town now turned skiers&#x2019; paradise. The first floor of the front part of the store was one big space that was filled with handmade wood shelving. The floors were also wood, original with plenty of long-ago-made scratches and marks to prove it. The walls were simple, now painted a soft blue where they weren&#x2019;t covered by shelves, either the shelves that Chester had built to hold the different types of paper we sold, or the now-antique shelving from the days of the mining company.</p><p>The mining company shelves extended down the middle of both of the sidewalls and were protected by ornately carved wooden doors depicting scenes of the beautiful and mountainous country and wildlife around Star City. The doors were works of art, and we&#x2019;d had plenty of customers visit who just wanted to take pictures of the carved doors. We welcomed them in, and if Chester was in the mood, he&#x2019;d come out and tell the visitors a story about the doors. He made up a different story every time. He figured he was just giving the visitors something fun to think about; I thought he&#x2019;d probably get in trouble someday for his fibs, but he didn&#x2019;t seem to be concerned.</p><p>Filling the shelves were papers and note cards and envelopes of varying sizes, colors, and designs. Things were organized by color, and in some instances by complementary colors, like dark forest green and red. Or silver and gold. We had so many different animal note cards that we&#x2019;d had to reorganize them by baby animals, adult animals, and then even further by which country they inhabited. Giraffes could be found on the Africa shelves, both under the baby animal and adult animal sub-categories.</p><p>There were windows along the top of the side walls that lit the entire space as the sun rose on one side and set on the other, finally slipping away every day behind one or another mountaintop, depending upon the time of the year. We had some light fixtures on the ceiling above but typically only turned them on in the late afternoon during the winter. Most of the time our cat, Baskerville, sat somewhere atop a set of shelves. He was there today, on the west side, enjoying the late-morning sun coming in the east windows. He&#x2019;d move over to the other side soon.</p><p>The petite but surly calico meowed a suspicious greeting as he looked down upon us.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, kitty,&#x201d; Mirabelle said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that cat likes me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Baskerville doesn&#x2019;t like many people,&#x201d; I said as I eyed the cat that I adored despite how he might feel about me or anyone else. He was the offspring of the very first calico who&#x2019;d roamed the store. Arial had been my friend and companion whenever I&#x2019;d visited The Rescued Word, my apr�s ski buddy who&#x2019;d sat with me while I drank hot chocolate and watched Chester either fix or print something.</p><p>Though I&#x2019;d taken to skiing just like almost everyone else in Star City, I&#x2019;d been the adolescent cursed with braces and glasses and wild, curly hair that went every direction except the right one. Chester, Arial, and the warm hot chocolate were my best friends for a long time. I still wore glasses, but the braces were long gone, and my curls had been tamed by some products that did what they promised.</p><p>Back then I had no idea that fixing typewriters, restoring books, printing things, and selling beautiful papers and pens would become my career. I just thought I was having fun. Arial had been a wonderful and loving cat. She had no idea that her son would turn out grouchy and misanthropic. I&#x2019;d always love and care for Baskerville, though, if only because Arial would appreciate the effort.</p><p>Though Chester had built most of the non-mining-company wood shelves inside the store, my brother and I had built the two shorter shelves that took up the middle of the space. The shelves had taken us a long time to build, mostly because he&#x2019;d been sixteen and I&#x2019;d been six, and neither of us had the patience needed to finish such a project quickly, but Jimmy and I were still proud of our handiwork.</p><p>The paper products we sold were imported from all over the world. Paper was important. The way ink moved over the paper was important. Ink itself was probably the most important thing of all. Jimmy and I had a game we played&#x2014;Chester&#x2019;s seven degrees of ink separation. Everyone and everything could be tied to ink in seven moves or less. Ink was somehow more important than blood; well, to Chester, at least.</p><p>The front portion of the store also displayed finer writing instruments and Chester&#x2019;s favorite pencil, the only one he&#x2019;d ever use. Trusty No. 2 pencil&#x2013;filled cups were placed all around the store. Many people bought a pencil or two, plucking them out of a cup on impulse, unable to resist the appeal of the memories the yellow No. 2s evoked.</p><p>I thought Mirabelle had come into the store to pick up more blue paper but we passed all the paper without stopping, and she was still behind me as we approached the back counter. I sent her an apologetic half smile when we both noticed my niece behind the counter, slunked down in one chair, her feet up on another as she moved with the beat of whatever song played in her earbuds. Her eyes were closed, and she had no idea that either I or a customer was in the building.</p><p>I supported the Underwood on my hip and knocked on the top of the counter, startling Marion to opened-eyed surprise.

When she died, their two children were already gone from the house, so he saw no reason to do much of anything but ski whenever he could and work. He sold the house and the lawnmower and moved to the second floor of his building, taking down walls and adding appliances to make it an open and comfortable space, particularly for a bachelor. Even though I do most of the work now, he claims he still loves living a mere twelve steps away from his store, and a quick walk to the nearest chairlift, of course.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Any e-mails?&#x201d; She had become our stationery personalization pro, doing the work on the computer we kept behind the counter.</p><p>&#x201c;I just got a couple of orders, but nothing urgent.&#x201d; She nodded toward the monitor.</p><p>I looked back toward the front, contemplating which task I wanted Marion to tackle first.

Widely respected among members of the Catholic faith, this book depicts the human experience of spirituality by examining the nature of the soul, path to salvation, and strategies for strengthening one's union with God.

C.F. comes out of the mythic Providence, Rhode Island art and noise scene--his musical alias is Kites. In a recent profile <i>The Comics Reporter</i> observes, &#x201c;Contrasting sharply with many of his flashier contemporaries, [C.F.&#x2019;s] primary skill lies in overlooked nuances of comics storytelling, in particular pacing.&#x201d; His distinctive voice and intricate rendering skills have attracted attention from the groundbreaking comics anthology, <i>Kramers Ergot</i>--he was included in the fourth issue, and featured on the cover of the fifth. Here, C.F.&#x2019;s epic fantasy--an allegorical tale where power, physical identity and even gender are always in flux--picks up steam: Buell Kazee sneaks down into the cellar of the plex knowe crypt and conjures trouble; Tetradyne Cola takes a nap and dreams of Monica Glass and the lemon sparklers of star studio; members of the Marker clan compare notes on their magical crimes and the witches of Lace Temblor conspire over transmutation night.</p><p>The second installment in a planned six-novel cycle from Providence, R.I.&#x2013;based artist Chris Forgues (aka C.F., who records music as Kites and self-publishes the comic Low Tide) comes with a map and illustrative list of all major characters; readers will need the help. There are great beasts and disturbed individuals (with names like Buell Kazee and Mosfet Warlock), all navigating narratives of madness and violence in a woozily concocted world that centers around something called the Plex Knowe Crypt. C.F.'s style is that of the vaguely disturbed outsider artist, replete with spurting fluids and grievous bodily harm, shot through with the occasional blast of Yellow Submarine&#x2013;era psychedelia. The stories don't make much impact on their own but appear to be tiny glimpses of an epic fantasy brewing in the artist's mind. Unfortunately, until the entire work is unveiled, Powr Mastrs will most intrigue readers who crave new frontiers in graphic novel expression. (Dec.)

The young women then&#x2014;their fervent beauty is well captured in the cover image&#x2014;are grandmothers now; their feminism was declared unfashionable years ago,&nbsp;though abuses they sought to correct continue. Women poets are still read, reviewed, and taught less often than their male counterparts, and young women writers avoid seeming &#x201c;strident,&#x201d; a literary crime apparently worse than throttling the muse in the service of worldly ambition. Into such circumstances these direct, vibrant, potent, passionate, wild, strong, free, and freeing poems&nbsp;come less like a breath of fresh air than a strong wind.

Gordon hurried after her as she continued into the room.<br><br> "I don't care how important Newton Walker thinks the man is to his company, he's a boor and a bully and I'll never have him in the house again." She pointed to the carriage clock on the mantel. "It's not even nine o'clock and our guests have gone. Most of them didn't even bother to finish their dessert. That wretched man ruined our Bonfire Night festivities." She grimaced as a loud noise boomed through the house. "Hear that? Fireworks are still going off, people are out having fun and enjoying the evening, but not us. There's no revelry here, there's no November the fifth celebration for us, thanks to that odious fellow." She glared at her husband in exasperation. "You shouldn't have told him about the shortcut through the mews-it would have served him right to go the long way around. Well, I for one hope that Christopher Gilhaney breaks an ankle when he takes that shortcut. It'll be dark enough, that's for certain."<br><br> Unlike his host and hostess, the man in question had thoroughly enjoyed himself at the Chase dinner party. He chuckled as he went farther into the mews, squinting just a bit to make his way. Mind you, it had ended a bit early for his taste, but he�d had a fine meal as well as the satisfaction of watching them squirm. He pulled his coat tighter against the chill night air and smiled as he remembered the shocked expressions on each of their faces as he�d quietly attacked them with his carefully scripted comments. God, it had been glorious and it was just the beginning. Before he was finished, the whole lot of them would be sorry.<br><br> Another explosion rocked the night, this time from the direction of the river. Shouts and laughter mingled with the faint, acrid scent of smoke and for a brief moment, he was overcome with nostalgia. He wished he were back in the old days, back when he'd have been on the banks of the Thames with his beloved Polly and their friends; drinking beer, watching the bonfires, and setting off the few fireworks they could afford. But those times were long gone. Polly was long gone.<br><br> He slowed his steps as he moved farther into the darkness, but his eyesight was excellent and he could easily see his way. Tonight had been far more successful than he'd hoped. When Chase had originally invited him, he'd been going to content himself with firing off a few verbal salvos. But his well-rehearsed comments had hit their individual targets with amazing success and, one after another, they'd fled the battlefield. Silly fools, this war was just beginning. He felt a bit bad about poor Mrs. Chase; she'd looked horrified as her guests disappeared, but she'd get over it.<br><br> Another burst of fireworks exploded into the noisy night, rising above the shouts, screams, and laughter now coming from all directions. Bonfire Night was drawing to a close and he, for one, intended to get home to his warm bed. The November night was cold and the dampness was seeping through his shoes and into his feet.<br><br> As the fireworks faded, he heard footsteps ahead. He stopped for a moment and listened. Someone had come into the mews from the other end, but he wasn't overly alarmed. There were a lot of people out and about tonight and he wasn't the only person using this shortcut. It slashed a quarter of a mile off the walk between Chelsea and the railway station. Nonetheless, he put his hand in his pocket and slipped his fingers through the brass knuckles he carried for protection. It paid to be cautious.<br><br> Ahead of him, a figure emerged and came steadily toward him. The sky suddenly dimmed as the moon slipped behind the clouds so he couldn't see anything except a human shape, but whoever it was moved to the opposite side of the mews. Apparently, they, too, were wary of meeting strangers in dark places.<br><br> Reassured, he picked up his pace and began planning what he'd do tomorrow. Newton had told him the first clerks arrived at eight o'clock. He intended to be there at five past eight. He wanted a few words with the accounts clerks before anyone else was present. Newton had assured him that the management didn't arrive till nine at the earliest.<br><br> His companion was now close enough for him to make out some details. His steps faltered as he realized whoever it was wore a shapeless, hooded cloak, a garment that looked like it should be hanging around the figure of one of the Old Guy effigies along the riverbank. The cloak covered whoever it was from head to toe, making it impossible to determine if it was a male or female. Surprised, he stared as they came level and then passed each other on opposite sides of the mews. Suddenly uneasy, because there was something about the figure that simply wasn't right, he sucked in a deep breath of air and hurried toward the gas lamp at the far end.<br><br> A rash of fireworks went off, along with cheering and shouting from the throngs near the Thames. But despite the noise, his sharp hearing caught the sound of footsteps racing toward him and he turned, pulling the hand wearing the brass knuckles out of his pocket as he moved.<br><br> But he was too late; just as the last of the sound of explosions filled the air, the cloaked figure held out a gun and fired three bullets straight into his heart.<br><br> Christopher Gilhaney had barely hit the ground before his assailant knelt down and pulled the brass knuckles off his cold, dead hand.<br><br> Inspector Nigel Nivens stood in Chief Superintendent Barrows� third-floor office at Scotland Yard and argued that he was the right man for the task. �This isn�t a murder, it is a robbery gone wrong. According to his landlady, when he left his lodging house last night, Mr. Gilhaney was wearing a diamond stickpin on his cravat and a gold ring with a black stone in the center. Neither of those items was found on his body.�<br><br> Nivens was a man of medium height with dark blond hair graying at the temples, bulbous blue eyes, cheeks that were turning to jowls, and a thick mustache. He wore a gray pinstriped suit tailored to disguise the fact that he was running too fat around his middle.<br><br> Chief Superintendent Barrows stared at him impassively. He now wished he'd gone with his first instinct when he'd been informed of the murder last night and called in Inspector Witherspoon. But he'd hesitated and now, given the politics of the Home Office and Nivens' family's influence, he was probably stuck with the fellow. Drat. "The landlady is prepared to swear at the inquest that he had those items on his person when he left her premises?"<br><br> "She is, sir. This crime was most definitely a robbery, and as such, I believe I'm the most qualified to handle the case, not Inspector Witherspoon. What's more, Kilbane Mews is well within my district, not Witherspoon's."<br><br> "When it comes to murder, you know good and well that the spot where the corpse was found isn't the most important factor. Catching the killer is." Barrows pushed his glasses up his nose and leaned back in his chair. He toyed with the idea of giving the case to Witherspoon simply because he didn't like Nivens, but at this juncture, that might cause more trouble than it was worth. The fellow was from a family that had both money and aristocratic connections. Nivens wasn't a bad copper, but he wasn't a brilliant one, either, and they needed this crime solved. On the other hand, if the killing of Christopher Gilhaney was the result of a botched robbery and not murder, then perhaps he was more qualified to handle the case; he was actually quite good at solving burglaries and catching robbers.<br><br> But Barrows wanted to ensure that justice was done properly as well. He might be in administration now, but he was still a policeman at heart. "What's more, I'm not as certain as you seem to be that the crime was a robbery. Gilhaney died from three gunshots to his chest. Robbers and ruffians don't use guns. If they get violent at all, they cosh their victim over the head or knock the wind out of him."<br><br> Nivens was ready for that question. "What about the Ogden case? Harry Ogden was killed by a gun when he was robbed. He was shot twice."<br><br> "Yes, but it was his own pistol," Barrows reminded him. "Ogden carried it for protection, remember? He was only shot with it because Jack Rayley, his assailant, grabbed it when Ogden pulled it out of his pocket."<br><br> "I know that, Chief Superintendent, but nonetheless, it was a case of a firearm used during the course of a robbery, which means that regardless of the circumstances, it's likely this is merely a case of a botched robbery, not a murder." Nivens' gaze flicked to the window. He stared at the busy boat and barge traffic on the Thames. He needed to make a compelling argument to keep this case away from Inspector Witherspoon. He was sick and tired of Gerald Witherspoon always being the one the Yard called upon when there was a newsworthy case to be solved. "Furthermore, there was the case in Brighton last month of another gun being used in a robbery. That young hotel clerk who was taking the day's receipts to the bank. If you'll recall, sir, that resulted in a shooting as well. The clerk was wounded in the leg and the perpetrators managed to get away."<br><br> "Brighton isn't London," Barrows said.<br><br> "But it isn't that far from London, sir. What's more, the criminals that committed the Brighton robbery could have easily come here. My point is this, sir: We've seen a steady rise in the number of cases involving firearms. There was also that shooting in Stepney, sir, and the victim claimed he was being robbed."<br><br> "The victim was a Whitechapel thug that was involved in a fight for territory with the Stepney gang. He only came up with that story to keep from being arrested himself." Barrows sighed inwardly. "But in one sense, you're right. There is some evidence that points to the increased use of firearms. So you can take this case."<br><br> Nivens nodded smartly. "Thank you, sir."<br><br> "Don't thank me, Inspector-I expect you to find the person or persons that did this dreadful crime."<br><br> "Of course, sir. I've got constables out questioning the locals, just in case someone might have seen something, and I've got the word out to my network of informers so we should have something from that quarter soon."<br><br> "Good, we've already got the Home Office sticking their oar in so I'll expect you to take care of this quickly and efficiently."<br><br> "I assure you, sir"-Nivens gave him a tight smile-"I've every confidence I shall have it solved in just a few days."<br><br> But the case wasn�t solved in a few days or, for that matter, weeks later. It was as if the assailant had simply vanished into thin air.<br><br> Nivens stood outside of Barrows' office and took a deep, calming breath. He knew why he'd been summoned here and it wasn't so that the chief superintendent could compliment him on a job well done. He was at his wits' end, but blast it, it wasn't his fault. No one, not even the great Witherspoon, could have solved this case.<br><br> None of the neighbors in the mews had paid any attention to loud noises. After all, it was Bonfire Night and half the city was letting off fireworks, drinking like sailors, and screaming as the "Old Guy" burned. A few gunshots wouldn't have stood out. Nor had anyone seen a suspicious figure in the area-again, it was November the fifth and half of London was out roaming the streets.<br><br> His network of informers had also drawn a blank. No diamond stickpins or gold rings had shown up at any of the dodgy pawnshops suspected of fencing stolen goods. No matter how much pressure he applied, no one, not even his most reliable informers, had heard anything about a botched robbery.<br><br> It was now December eighteenth and Nivens knew he had to come up with a way to deflect the blame off himself or, failing that, make sure that Witherspoon took over the case. That was the only way he could rebound from this failure. This crime wasn't going to be solved by anyone, but if he tried to make that argument right now, Barrows wouldn't believe it. Their glorious inspector, the one who'd solved more crimes than anyone in the history of the Metropolitan Police Force, needed to fail as well.<br><br> Now he just had to make certain that Barrows handed the case to the right person. Getting rid of this case was the wisest course; if anyone was to have a black mark against his record, let it be Gerald Witherspoon. Nivens smiled in satisfaction. He'd go ahead and enjoy the holidays by accepting Lord Ballinger's invitation to spend Christmas at his estate in Scotland. He chuckled as he lifted his hand and knocked on the door.<br><br> "Come in."<br><br> He stepped inside. "Good morning, sir. I understand you wish to see me."<br><br> Barrows looked up from the open file on his desk. "I'd like you to explain yourself, Inspector. I've gone through your reports on the Gilhaney case and there's not so much as a hint that you're close to an arrest. For God's sake, Nivens, what's going on here? You insisted that you'd be able to solve this case easily, but it's been six weeks!"</p><h2>NIV, The Books of the Bible: The Prophets, Hardcover: Listen to God&#x2019;s Messengers Proclaiming Hope and Truth (2)</h2><p><p><strong>Read and Engage with Scripture in a Whole New Way!</strong></p><p><em>The Books of the Bible&nbsp;</em>is a fresh yet ancient presentation of Scripture.&nbsp;As many distractions as possible have been eliminated so readers can experience each book the way its authors intended.

With a passion to become an old-time banjo player, David traveled to remote mountain communities like Kingdom Come, Kentucky and Sodom Laurel, North Carolina searching for the best traditional musicians. Holt found hundreds of old-time mountaineers with a wealth of folk music, stories and wisdom. There was banjoist Wade Mainer, ballad singer Dellie Norton, singing coal miner Nimrod Workman, and 122 year-old washboard player Susie Brunson. Holt learned to play not only the banjo but also many unusual instruments like the mouth bow, the bottleneck slide guitar and even the paper bag.</p><p>For over three decades, David's passion for traditional music and culture has fueled a successful performing and recording career. He has earned four Grammy Awards and performed and recorded with many of his mentors including Doc Watson, Grandpa Jones, Bill Monroe, Earl Scruggs, Roy Acuff, and Chet Atkins. Today he tours the country performing solo with his band The Lightning Bolts and with Sutton, Holt, and Coleman. His work has been featured in a number of public television productions. </p><p><strong> </strong></p>As in Ready-to-Tell Tales, Holt and Mooney have solicited favorite selections from their fellow professional storytellers, including Margaret Read MacDonald, Len Cabral, and Jon Spelman. According to the introduction, each one of these 45 pieces has been "honed by countless tellings" and is sure to grab listeners right from the start. The editors urge readers to acknowledge the contributors of the tales they choose to tell and to develop their own style when performing them. The storyteller introduces each offering with notes about its history and provenance, any adaptations that may have been made to it, and the particular audience that will enjoy it. A profile of the contributor, a black-and-white photo, and performance tips accompany each selection. Folktales, tall tales, original tales, and tales adapted from literary sources are all included. Indexes provide access by country of origin and by age level. This book will be of most use to adults and older kids who tell stories, but may also interest those who just enjoy reading a good yarn.

Deaf Sentence tells the story of Desmond Bates, a recently retired linguistics professor in his mid-sixties. Vexed by his encroaching deafness and at loose ends in his personal life, Desmond inadvertently gets involved with a seemingly personable young American female student who seeks his support in matters academic and not so academic, who finally threatens to destabilize his life completely with her unpredictable-and wayward-behavior. What emerges is a funny, moving account of one man&#39;s effort to come to terms with aging and mortality-a classic meditation on modern middle age that fans of David Lodge will love.</p><p>David Lodge is the author of twelve novels and a novella, including the Booker Prize finalists <b>Small World</b> and <b>Nice Work</b>. He is also the author of many works of literary criticism, including <b>The Art of Fiction</b> and <b>Consciousness and the Novel</b>.In British writer Lodge's (<i>Author, Author</i>) modest 13th fictional effort, an elderly man's hearing loss embroils him in a sticky situation with a beautiful, manipulative young woman. Sexagenarian Desmond Bates wears a hearing aid after being diagnosed some 20 years earlier with acquired deafness and consistently misinterprets people's words (which Lodge milks to maximum comic effect). Bates longs for activities after his retirement from teaching applied linguistics, other than contemplating e-mail spam about erectile dysfunction and watching his wife, Winifred, enjoy her success as an interior designer. The novel takes the form of his newly begun daily diary. At a gallery event, Bates mistakenly agrees to help shapely, enigmatic American student Alex Loom with her Ph.D. thesis on suicide notes. It quickly becomes clear that Loom's intentions are anything but academic and her instability shakes not only the sound foundations of Bates's family life but his long-since-stagnant fantasy life as well. Lodge's amiable, deliberate narrative tickles like a feather, but his frequent pauses for lengthy, expository grace notes may not appeal to every reader. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After the Second World War Eugen Herrigel introduced the concept of kyudo to the West in his classic Zen in the Art of Japanese Archery. But until now, no Japanese kyudo master has published a book on his art in English.<br>In <i>Kyudo</i>: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery, Hideharu Onuma and his American co-authors, Dan and Jackie DeProspero, explain in detail both the spiritual and practical aspects of kyudo. Written with both novices and advanced students in mind, the book is presented in simple, straightforward language and features hundreds of detailed illustrations, supplemented by rare photographs of Master Onuma, clearly demonstrating the fundamental techniques and daily practice of this form of "standing Zen."<br>Including chapters on equipment and kyudojo construction, <i>Kyudo</i>: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery is the most comprehensive reference work on the subject available. Special sections on problem solving and shitsu (errors) also make it a unique teaching and learning resource, and the concluding shiteimondo (teacher-student dialogue) provides unparalleled insights into the thoughts and teachings of a true master of the martial arts.</p><p><b>HIDEHARU ONUMA</b> was the 15th-generation headmaster of the Heki Ryu Sekka-ha school of archery and kyudo banshi, 9th dan. He was born in Tokyo in 1910 into a highly respected archery family.

In 1988 Dan DeProspero passed his examination for kyudo renshi (instructor's license). The following year he was promoted to 6th dan.

Above all, you need to be known and accepted for who you are. But how do you &nbsp;find and maintain this kind of friendship in a fluid and frenetic culture?<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Known</i>, Dick and Ruth Foth offer inspiration and proven practices to build relationships through personal storytelling and affirmation. They draw on years of mentoring, rich relationships, and the model of Jesus to show you why friendship is one of the keys to a full life and the greatest gift we can give to each other.</p><p><b>Dick Foth</b> is an author, storyteller, and popular speaker. He holds a master&#x2019;s degree from Wheaton College Graduate School and a doctorate from Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary. He and Ruth have invested the last twenty-five years working in the marketplace of business and government to encourage leaders in their personal lives.&nbsp; Dick also serves on the teaching teams of four congregations, including the multisite National Community Church pastored by Mark Batterson in Washington, D. C.&nbsp; <br> <b><br>Ruth Foth</b> has an English degree from Bethany College in California and she is a homemaker, gardener, and quilter. The Foths live in Colorado and have four children and many grandchildren.<b>Foreword</b><br> &nbsp;<br> If you gave me a word association test and said, &#x201c;Relationships,&#x201d; my immediate response would be, &#x201c;Dick Foth.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve never met anyone who does relationships better! And I&#x2019;ve been the beneficiary of that fact for two decades now. Of course, it takes two to tango. And one of the beautiful things about this book is that we don&#x2019;t just get Dick&#x2019;s viewpoint; we also get Ruth&#x2019;s reflections! And trust me, when Ruth speaks you want to listen very closely, very carefully! There is a raw honesty and profound dimensionality to this book because it&#x2019;s two-part harmony.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was a rookie pastor trying to find my way in ministry and in marriage, Dick Foth befriended me. Dick and Ruth invited Lora and me over to their home for our first Thanksgiving in Washington, DC. When Ruth served up a warm berry cobbler for dessert, I knew it was a friendship that needed to be cultivated!<br> &nbsp;<br> Dick Foth has been a spiritual father to me for more than two decades now. He&#x2019;s been a sounding board for difficult decisions. He&#x2019;s offered encouraging words during tough times. And he&#x2019;s not afraid to ask the tough questions! In fact, he rarely asks me how I&#x2019;m doing. He usually asks me how my wife and children are doing! Dick knows that it&#x2019;s our relationships with those who are closest to us that is the best barometer of how we&#x2019;re doing personally!<br> &nbsp;<br> Simply put, there isn&#x2019;t anyone I&#x2019;ve learned more from than Dick Foth. And you&#x2019;re about to discover why I love and honor Dick and Ruth so much. This book is pure gold&#x2014;gold that has been refined by seventy-five trips around the sun and fifty years of marriage. You&#x2019;ll find a few theories in this book, but those theories are backed up by hard-earned, down-to-earth lessons about life, love, and catching tadpoles!<br> &nbsp;<br> Dick and Ruth now live near Fort Collins, Colorado, but Dick graciously returns to Washington, DC, to speak at National Community Church several times a year. Every time I announce that he&#x2019;s coming, our church gives him an ovation. For the record, they don&#x2019;t clap for anyone else, including me! Our congregation is very young&#x2014;about half are twentysomethings&#x2014;and my theory is that Dick is the grandfather they always wish they had. You&#x2019;ll feel the same way about Dick and Ruth just a few pages into this book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dick is one of my favorite communicators, one of the best communicators on the planet. He can tell a story like nobody&#x2019;s business. But after listening to his preaching for more than twenty years now, I think I know his secret sauce. No matter what text he&#x2019;s speaking on, no matter what context he&#x2019;s speaking in, he has a reassuring message that comes through calm and clear: it&#x2019;s going to be okay!<br> &nbsp;<br> Dick and Ruth have weathered some storms, including the divorce of Dick&#x2019;s parents. They&#x2019;ve walked through their fair share of tough times as husband and wife, father and mother. And they&#x2019;ve been good old-fashioned friends to so many people during Dick&#x2019;s tenure as pastor, college president, and friend to some of the most powerful people in politics during their years in Washington, DC. But through thick and thin, despite all the ups and downs, they&#x2019;re still standing. And not just standing, smiling!<br> &nbsp;<br> The sad reality is that we live in a very shallow world, but if anyone can help you build deep friendships, it&#x2019;s Dick and Ruth Foth. Whether it&#x2019;s overcoming the aches and pains of loneliness or taking your friendships to a deeper place, you&#x2019;ve come to the right place.<br> &nbsp;<br> A book is a two-way street. The authors invite you into their lives, and you get to discover a whole new world. I think you&#x2019;ll love Dick and Ruth&#x2019;s world. But the reader also invites the authors into their world. I believe your life will be better because of it. I know mine has been forever imprinted, forever impacted.<br> <i>&#x2014;Mark&nbsp;Batterson</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <b>Introduction</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>What Really Matters</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Words are easy, like the wind;<br> Faithful friends are hard to find.<br> <b>&#x2014;William&nbsp;Shakespeare, The Passionate Pilgrim</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The question I asked the university student was casual.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a word that you&#x2019;d use to describe your generation?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He said, &#x201c;Overwhelmed!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> I said, &#x201c;What do you mean? What are you overwhelmed by?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> When I heard overwhelmed, I saw my parents&#x2014;born in 1910 and 1913 respectively&#x2014;who lived through World War I, the influenza epidemic of 1917&#x2013;18, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Information,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My generation is overwhelmed by information.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> When he said information, two facts I had recently seen popped into my head: Children born in the 1990s belong to the first generation in the history of the world that<br><b>-</b> do not have to go to an authority figure for information,1 and,<br> <b>-</b> will be able to access more new information that will be generated this year than in the previous five thousand years combined!2<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re so connected to each other,&#x201d; I continued.<br> &nbsp;<br> He said, &#x201c;Oh, yes! I&#x2019;m connected to several dozen people through Facebook and Twitter. I just don&#x2019;t know how to start a conversation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His words jarred me. For me, face-to-face conversation is the stuff of life. My thoughts zipped to Penn Station in New York City ten years earlier. Ruth and I were sitting in a hole-in- the-<br> wall Pizza Hut waiting for our train to Washington, DC. An older woman approached our table and asked if she could join us because seating was scarce. &#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; we said.<br> &nbsp;<br> As we talked, she told us of graduating from a major midwestern university as a young woman and going to work for Hallmark in their creative department. She rose to the executive ranks in marketing, where she spent the rest of her career and from which she retired. When we asked, &#x201c;What brought you to New York?&#x201d; she said that she had been talked into coming out of retirement two years earlier to join the marketing department of a large New York company.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the biggest difference in the workplace now for you?&#x201d; she replied, &#x201c;It bothers me when a young person sends me an e-mail on a subject, while sitting five feet away in the next cubicle.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why does that matter?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s efficient.&#x201d; She got quiet for a moment, then looked straight at us and said, &#x201c;I miss the face-to-face, the eye contact. Eye contact makes us human.&#x201d; I doubt that she had read the work of Atsushi Senju, a cognitive neuroscientist, who says, &#x201c;A richer mode of communication is possible right after making What Really Matters 3 eye contact. It amplifies your ability to compute all the signals so you are able to read the other person&#x2019;s brain.&#x201d;3<br> &nbsp;<br> The older woman wasn&#x2019;t making a scientific statement. She was making a visceral statement. Just like my young university friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the young man said, &#x201c;Overwhelmed&#x201d; and &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to start a conversation,&#x201d; it was a Penn Station echo. Intrigued, I listened. And he schooled me. He had good reason to feel overwhelmed. Come to think of it, I feel that way myself half the time. The Niagara of information we have access to can drown us. How we keep up, sort through, choose, and prioritize can paralyze us. Instant access has changed everything: education, sports, business, politics, and of course, shopping!<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, nothing has changed more than the way we talk to each other.<br> &nbsp;<br> Communication is the name of the game. Our brains are Exhibit One. A communication marvel, the brain automatically sends and receives millions of messages a day throughout our bodies. Person-to-person communication, on the other hand, takes intent. Every arena of life&#x2014;business,<br> sports, medicine, education, the military, and families, to name a few&#x2014;work only as well as we communicate. Why? Because great communication creates relationship, and relationship drives our whole lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> At stake in this new reality, where we have keyboard control over what we wish others to know about us, is the depth of the relationships we want to build. We have all kinds of relationships, but apart from family, none is more meaningful than a friendship. Friendship, by definition, is unique. It&#x2019;s about investment and vulnerability. So trying 4 Introduction to make a friend at light speed is brutal. On the Internet, I can give you information, but it&#x2019;s hard to give you me. That process does not happen at the tap of a key.<br> &nbsp;<br> How then do relationships get started? What nurtures them? When God says, &#x201c;It is not good that man should be alone,&#x201d; we know he&#x2019;s not kidding. Because we know alone. How do we get beyond that reality? What do we need to understand to create any kind of connection, let alone a friendship?<br> &nbsp;<br> Glance with us for a moment in the rearview mirror. How do kids make friends? When we are young, we develop friendships on the fly. Mostly, they come from play. When I was young, I lived to play. Looking back, play set the stage for my first friendship.<br> &nbsp;<br> My parents moved from Oakland, California, to south India when I was three years old. The next five years framed how I see the world to this day. But the year we returned to the States framed how I see friendship. We came to Springfield, Missouri, in the summer of 1950. The Blue Mountains of southwest India were as different from the Ozark Mountains of southwest Missouri as curried chicken was from biscuits and gravy.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was there that I got my first bike, a bright red Schwinn. That bike became my ticket to a world of Royal Crown Colas and Eskimo Pies saturated in Ozark accents and open-door hospitality. Those were good times. And John David made them better.<br> &nbsp;<br> John David lived three doors up from us on Williams Street on the north edge of Springfield. Born within two months of each other in the spring of 1942, he and I had chemistry. Whatever that means, we had it. We were Marco Polos on bikes, racing through the nearby local zoo and county fairgrounds, ranging out, when time and parents allowed, to Doling Park and the James River.<br> &nbsp;<br> We only lived in Springfield one year, but that year was filled with fishing and hiking and spelunking through caves. The days were riddled with BB gun wars, wrestling matches, and games of every kind. The greater the challenge meant the greater the fun.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we explored Doling Park Lake that spring, we found the tepid water at the lake&#x2019;s edge to be a perfect hatching site for tadpoles. Hundreds of tadpoles. Huge tadpoles. Tadpoles with oversized heads and sweeping tails. We became hunters. They became the hunted. Armed with Folgers coffee cans nailed to scrap-furring strips, we captured a bunch of those denizens of the shallows.<br> &nbsp;<br> We took them back to the unfinished concrete basement of the Foth house and put them in a galvanized washtub. I don&#x2019;t remember what we fed them or how many survived the trauma. All I remember is being amazed when tails fell off and legs grew. In a few weeks, on a humid June night, the full-throated baritone songs of their cousins back at the lake filled the darkness. And we knew that something wondrous had happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking back on that year, another wondrous thing had happened: I had made a friend. My very first real friend. A friend to talk to and play with. A friend to fight and dream with. A friend with whom I could morph and grow. A friend for the adventure called life.<br> &nbsp;<br> We left Springfield for Oakland, California, in August of 1951. John David and I would connect every so often over the next decades, but it would be more than forty years before we lived near each other again. Then it would be in Washington, DC. By that time, John David Ashcroft had served twice as attorney general of Missouri, twice as governor, one term as senator, and&#x2014;during<br> our years in DC&#x2014;would become the seventy-ninth attorney general of the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Relationships come and go. Some are for a season; others just for a moment. But some are for a lifetime. At this writing, John David and I have been friends for over sixty-five years!<br> &nbsp;<br> That said, 1950 is gone forever. How people relate to each other today has been transformed. We live in a high-tech, digital world that promotes connections which often mimic relationship, but are far from what we actually yearn for when we look for meaningful community. Through our network and connections, we can have a feeling of being close without real touching. Dr. Sherry Turkle of MIT, in Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other, puts it this way:<br> Technology proposes itself as the architect of our intimacies. . . . Digital connections and the sociable robot may offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. Our networked life allows us to hide from each other even as we are tethered to each other.4<br> &nbsp;<br> Please understand. I love technology and social media. The ease that it offers in discovering the world is a playground for guys like me. To hear from our friends on Facebook or see our twelve grandkids&#x2019; grins on Skype is wonderful. But sometimes what we think is happening isn&#x2019;t happening. Like an old North Carolinian friend of mine said so often, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happenin&#x2019; ain&#x2019;t what&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The world of technology and social media can present itself in an alluring way, but it often gives me more than I want and less than I need. It changes daily. Platforms and devices shift like the weather. It offers me a lot of things and takes me lots of places. Specifically, it takes me wide. Where it cannot easily take me is deep. So, where do I go to find deep?<br> &nbsp;<br> There is built into each of us the need not just to connect but the need to engage. As we will see, we discover ourselves as we discover each other. We adapt to change, but we yearn for stability. We love to have wings, but we also need roots. Friendship can deliver both wings and roots.<br> &nbsp;<br> You already know I&#x2019;m an older guy. I like to think I won&#x2019;t be officially old until I&#x2019;m ninety. But, at this writing, I am on my seventy-fifth trip around the sun. So life has worked me over a bit. In the process, I&#x2019;ve discovered that certain things make us human and certain things make life work. Old Archimedes, the greatest scientist of his day, spoke to that idea. Born in 287 BC, he described how levers work and gave us one of the most quotable lines in history: &#x201c;Give me a place to stand, and I&#x2019;ll move the earth.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a physics principle and a great metaphor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where can you stand to get a solid footing in life? Where can you really be grounded?<br> &nbsp;<br> Ruth and I have a bias: get relationships right and everything else follows. Our first seven years of life were spent in very different spaces geographically, but they had a common theme: relationship was king.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were both born in California. I was an Oakland guy, and she was a San Joaquin Valley girl. I was city. She was farm. Then things changed. At the age of three, I left all extended family and sailed to India with my parents and sister. Ruth stayed in ranch and farming country north of Modesto surrounded...</p><h2>Edgar Cayce on Vibrations: Spirit in Motion</h2><p>In spite of how the physical world may appear to the naked eye, science has proved that all of materiality consisting of atoms and therefore protons, neutrons, and electrons is in motion. Everything is a vibration. Even the body&#39;s five senses operate through the use of vibrations. However, vibrations encompass much, much more. This work explores how everything from consciousness to the material world is connected to vibration. It examines how we continue to create and shape those vibrations and how vibrations impact the world around us. Ultimately, it examines how all vibrations are essentially the one spirit in motion.</p><p>KEVIN J.

Later revealed as having been written with the Princess's full cooperation, this book is now widely regarded as her official biography. Yet it was not the full story, nor could it have been, given the circumstances at the time. This is even more apparent in the light of the events that have occurred since her death, which have been played out under the harsh gaze of&nbsp;the media, once again catapulting Diana's name back into the spotlight. Figures such as her sometime lover James Hewitt, her butler Paul Burrell, and Prince Charles's valet, Michael Fawcett, have emerged, while intriguing comments that Diana made to Morton in taped conversation have become extremely important in view of subsequent events. Friends, advisers, and colleagues, interviewed years after her death, feel a far greater freedom in speaking of her than they once did. In what is bound to be seen as the definitive study of the princess in the most crucial period of her short life, this book provides the last word on one of&nbsp;the best-loved figures of our era.</p><p><b>Andrew Morton</b> is a journalist and bestselling biographer whose books include <i>Angelina:&nbsp;An Unauthorized Biography</i>,&nbsp;<i>Tom Cruise:&nbsp;An Unauthorized Biography</i>, and <i>William &amp; Catherine:&nbsp;Their Story</i>. He has been interviewed by numerous&nbsp;outlets including People.com, <i>Today</i>, PBS's <i>Frontline</i>, CNN.com, and<i> Biography</i>.Celebrity biographer Morton&#x2019;s fourth book on Diana, Princess of Wales, doesn&#x2019;t contain the shocking revelations of his first expos�, Diana: Her True Story (1992), but provoking a scandal isn&#x2019;t his intention with this book. Rather, he aims to shed light on Diana&#x2019;s true personality, which he feels has been distorted by the media and by those who knew or worked for her and subsequently exploited that association. With the help of Diana&#x2019;s close friends&#x2014;including her confidante, Dr. James Colthurst, and her astrologer, Debbie Frank&#x2014;Morton paints a portrait of a princess who, despite her beauty, kindness and popularity, was deeply afflicted by self-doubt, extremely dependent on the counsel of her friends and desperate for a man to love her. "Her heart truly ruled her head," Diana&#x2019;s masseur, Stephen Twigg, told Morton, and indeed, her fierce determination to enjoy a passionate, genuine relationship is evident in this account. To break free of her loveless marriage, she was willing to defy centuries-old royal protocol and risk losing her position, wealth and even her beloved sons to the Queen, who was legally entitled to guardianship of William and Harry. After the divorce, she pinned her hopes for happiness on several men, adopting their interests and imagining a future with each of them. Morton portrays Diana as lonely and vulnerable, yet possessing an "indomitable spirit." However, he is unrelenting in his criticism of Diana&#x2019;s butler and onetime friend, Paul Burrell, whose memoir Morton blasts for being exploitative and biased against the Spencer family. Though Morton covers little new ground, he succeeds in putting Diana&#x2019;s actions in context and presenting a balanced assessment of this indelible figure. 32 pages of color photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

However, this is one debate which is not confined to the academy. </p><p>As Willem J. Ouweneel demonstrates in <em>The World is Christ's</em>, behind the scholarly terms lie very practical, everyday questions, such as where to shop, whether and how to vote, and how to educate our children. The Two Kingdoms controversy is at root a question of how we ought to understand and live in a world that refuses to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord. </p><p>Dr. Ouweneel details a number of historical, logical, and exegetical considerations surrounding these questions, and helps readers understand that <em>everything</em> we do is an act of worship--the issue is whether our worship is directed <em>toward</em> God or <em>away</em> from him. </p><p>It is through us that God wants to realize his kingdom, every day a bit further, in every domain of life, because the world is Christ's.</p></p><p>Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Systematic Theology at the Evangelical Theological Faculty, Leuven, Belgium.

Though he is open about his Dutchness, he writes in clear, beautiful, and cogent English prose. I am especially interested in his recent book <em>The World is Christ's: A Critique of Two Kingdoms Theology</em>. This book is a wonderful volume, the most thorough treatment of the two-kingdoms controversy that there is. In 400 pages, he details a huge number of historical, logical, and exegetical considerations. I think his case for a one kingdom theology is quite cogent. In any case, this book will have to be the starting point for any further discussion of the matter. I will not respect future articles and books on this subject unless they show a thorough understanding of Ouweneel's argument. </p><p><strong>--John M.

Covey<br><br>Success that endures -- sustainable and balanced success -- can seem difficult to achieve in today's turbulent, complex world of change. But those who achieve this kind of success live by seven universal, timeless, self-evident principles that apply in any situation, in any culture.<br> <br>In <i>Living the 7 Habits: The Courage to Change,</i> Dr. Covey shows how successful people have used these principles to solve problems, overcome obstacles, and change their lives. By showing how real people have used the principles to thrive in a changing world, he provides practical guidance and powerful inspiration to readers searching for a proven framework for living a meaningful life.</p><p>Stephen Covey's famous <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> has been teaching people and organizations how to be more effective since 1989. But how do Covey's principles translate for real people living their lives? <i>Living the 7 Habits</i> presents more than 70 little stories of people as they meet challenges and practice the seven habits. Some are ordinary slices of life; others are pivotal moments or life changes. A 76-year-old man who had overdrawn his wife's "emotional bank account" starts making deposits of chores, favors, and special dates until love is rekindled. A woman changes her life after her husband dies of cancer. Children teach parents empathic listening. A banker-turned-minister, cleaning his gun as his pregnant wife naps on the couch, accidentally discharges it, killing his wife and the unborn child, and learns to recover from grief and guilt. Parents learn to hear their teenagers' anxieties with respect and understanding. A clinical-psychology researcher, moved by statistics that one-third of foster kids never return to their birth parents or get adopted, creates a village for former "unadoptable" children, their new parents, and volunteer "grandparents." The stories are organized thematically into individual, family, community, education, and workplace--with commentary from Covey following each story. If you practice the seven habits and seek inspiration and a feeling of community, this book will help you find both. <i>--Joan Price</i>Recognized as one of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2019;s twenty-five most influential Americans, Stephen R.

Every man in his totality is subject to the laws of evolution by which he proceeds from the One to the many and back to the One, enriched by the experience of life in form and capable of contributing the results of that experience to the larger life which pervades him. </p><p> <br>Because the process of evolution is one of expansion in consciousness towards the centre of the One Life, an individual becomes increasingly identified with larger and larger areas of group consciousness; with the family and community group; with the nation; with the world and with the one humanity; with the soul and the ashramic group; and ultimately with those centres of consciousness we identify as hierarchy, the planetary heart inspiring the Plan; and with Shamballa, the planetary head centre of purpose, will and intention. This is a long process of discipleship growth and of service response to the requirements of the Plan and the needs of humanity. </p><p> <br>This book, therefore, includes much comment and teaching of the utmost value to the disciple in training for world service, learning to take his place within that subjectively united and organised group of disciples discussed in this volume as "the new group of world servers". Group consciousness is a major goal for every aspirant to discipleship. </p><p> <br>The first part of the book dealing with the Egoic Ray, includes sections on (1) The growth of soul influence (2) The seven laws of soul or group life (3) The five groups of souls and (4) Rules for inducing soul control. While the second part on The Ray of the Personality, contains detailed teaching on (1) The appropriation of the bodies (2) The coordination of the personality (3) Some problems of psychology and (4) Diseases and problems of disciples and mystics. </p><p> <br>The final part of this volume on Humanity Today anchors these pervasive thoughts and energies within the world arena. The world situation is viewed from the esoteric and Hierarchical angle and in relation to the requirements of the dawning new age of Aquarius. A synthesis of thought and a unity of purpose must be established in the world in order to create conditions in which peace can prosper and the Christ can reappear. </p><p> <br>Supreme effort was made by the Hierarchy to avert the 1939 outbreak of war, and to this end stimulating and evocative energies were literally forced into human consciousness through the agency of the new group of world servers. The requirements of the Plan for humanity were held up as the vision, without which "the people perish". Choosing to learn the hard way, humanity is only now opening the eye of vision as the result of drastic experience. </p><p> <br>Disciples and world servers, therefore, face a superlative opportunity today to equip themselves for service to the Plan, to humanity and to Hierarchy, by applying the psychology of the soul to every aspect of their life environment. </p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>Cornerstones of Georgia History: Documents That Formed the State</h2><p><p>This collection of fifty-nine primary documents presents multiple viewpoints on more than four centuries of growth, conflict, and change in Georgia.

For black Westerners, 1910 1920 did not represent the clear-cut promise of populist power, but a reordering of the complex social hierarchy which had, since the nineteenth century, granted them greater freedom in the borderlands than in the rest of the United States.<br>Despite its lasting significance, the story of black Americans along the Mexican border has been sorely underreported in the annals of U.S. history. Gerald Horne brings the tale to life in <b>Black and Brown</b>. Drawing on archives on both sides of the border, a host of cutting-edge studies and oral histories, Horne chronicles the political currents which created and then undermined the Mexican border as a relative safe haven for African Americans. His account addresses blacks' role as &#x201c;Indian fighters,&#x201d; the relationship between African Americans and immigrants, and the U.S. government's growing fear of black disloyalty, among other essential concerns of the period: the heavy reliance of the U.S. on black soldiers along the border placed white supremacy and national security on a collision course that was ultimately resolved in favor of the latter.<br> Mining a forgotten chapter in American history, <b>Black and Brown</b> offers tremendous insight into the past and future of race relations along the Mexican border.</p></p><p><b>Gerald Horne</b> is Moores Professor of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston, and has published three dozen books including, The Counter-Revolution of 1776: Slave Resistance and the Origins of the USA and Race War!

When Jason betrays his wife to marry the daughter of the king of Corinth, the very meanings of gratitude, indebtedness, criminality, and love&#x2014;maternal, paternal, filial, romantic&#x2014;are held up for scrutiny. M�d�e (1635) was Pierre Corneille&#x2019;s first tragedy; but perhaps because we assume it derivative of versions by Euripides and Seneca, it is little known in the English-speaking Americas.

Evoluant vers une utilisation systematique du pathetique et des intrigues plus complexes ("la Mort de Pompee, " 1643; "Rodogune, " 1644-1645; "Nicomede, " 1651), il connait avec "Pertharite" (1651) un echec qui l'eloigne du theatre pendant sept ans. Il traduit en vers l'"Imitation de Jesus-Christ" (1651-1656) et s'occupe de l'edition de son theatre, dont il definit les principes dans les "Examens" de ses pieces et trois "Discours" (1660). Revenu a la scene ("Oedipe, " 1659; "Sertorius, " 1662; "Sophonisbe, " 1663; "Attila, " 1667), il voit le public lui preferer Racine ("Tite et Berenice, " 1670). Corneille peint des heros -genereux- pour qui l'honneur et la gloire meritent tous les sacrifices.

Employing essays that consider race, culture, and difference in discussions about writing instruction and composition practices, Visions and Cyphers stresses the idea that writing is a fluid and purposeful mixture of language, design, and cultural choices. The essays featured in Visions and Cyphers are authored by an impressive range of diverse scholarly writers, each of whom is prominent in the field of composition and literacy studies and each of whom engages conversations about language, writing, culture, and rhetorical possibilities from intense and creative perspectives. <p> Complemented by discussion questions that prompt students to think about the authors rhetorical choices and the context and cultural relevance for writing, the essays in Visions and Cyphers help students puzzle through the complex theories that inform writing instruction to help them to take ownership of their writing development and their roles as social engineers and culture keepers.</p></p><p>David F.

In impassioned, elegant prose, celebrated author Susan Jacoby traces more than two hundred years of secularist activism, beginning with the fierce debate over the omission of God from the Constitution.

Ronald Reagan, whose record of religious observance during his Hollywood years was spotty at best, started turning up regularly at church services as soon as he was elected governor of California. Although Democrats have been more careful to separate private religious views from policy-making, Jimmy Carter, the first born-again Christian in the White House, and Bill Clinton, the first president to publicly ask God&#x2019;s forgiveness for adultery, did their part to blur the distinction between personal faith and civic responsibility. In the Bush White House, where Cabinet meetings routinely begin with a prayer, the institutionalization of religion has reached an apotheosis. Today, it is possible that Lincoln, who refused to join a church even though his advisers argued that some affiliation would help his election chances, could well be unacceptable as a major party presidential candidate.<br></p><h2>Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender, and the End of Normal (Queer Ideas/Queer Action)</h2><p><b>A roadmap to sex and gender for the twenty-first century, using Lady Gaga as a symbol for a new kind of feminism</b><br><br>Why are so many women single, so many men resisting marriage, and so many gays and lesbians having babies?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In&nbsp;<i>Gaga Feminism: Sex, Gender, and the End of Normal</i>, J. Jack Halberstam answers these questions while attempting to make sense of the tectonic cultural shifts that have transformed gender and sexual politics in the last few decades. This colorful landscape is populated by symbols and phenomena as varied as pregnant men, late-life lesbians, SpongeBob SquarePants, and queer families. So how do we understand the dissonance between these real lived experiences and the heteronormative narratives that dominate popular media? We can embrace the chaos! With equal parts edge and wit, Halberstam reveals how these symbolic ruptures open a critical space to embrace new ways of conceptualizing sex, love, and marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>Using Lady Gaga as a symbol for a new era, Halberstam deftly unpacks what the pop superstar symbolizes, to whom and why. The result is a provocative manifesto of creative mayhem, a roadmap to sex and gender for the twenty-first century, that holds Lady Gaga as an exemplar of a new kind of feminism that privileges gender and sexual fluidity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Part handbook, part guidebook, and part sex manual,&nbsp;<i>Gaga Feminism</i>&nbsp;is the first book to take seriously the collapse of heterosexuality and find signposts in the wreckage to a new and different way of doing sex and gender.</p><p><b>J.

Both were at an age when gender is not so fixed, and so, upon meeting them for the first time, I got what was for me a very predictable question from them both: &#x201c;Are you a boy or a girl?&#x201d; When I did not give a definitive answer, they came up with a category that worked for them&#x2014;boy/girl. They said it just like that, &#x201c;boygirl,&#x201d; as if it were one word, and, moreover, &nbsp;as if it were al- ready a well-known &nbsp;term and obvious at that. Since naming has been an issue my whole life (as a young person I was constantly mistaken &nbsp;for a boy; as an adult, &nbsp;my gender &nbsp;regularly &nbsp;confuses strangers), &nbsp;this simple resolution &nbsp;of my gender ambiguity within a term that &nbsp;stitches boy and girl together was liberating &nbsp;to say the least. Boygirl I am and boygirl I will remain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Of course, as time has passed, both kids, a boy and a girl, have recognized that the world sees me a little differently than they do. When people ask if I am their &#x201c;mum,&#x201d; they look baffled; when people call me &#x201c;sir,&#x201d; they seem comfortable; when a teacher refers to me as &#x201c;she,&#x201d; they roll with it but they persist in calling me &#x201c;he&#x201d; and their &#x201c;stepdad.&#x201d; The little girl happily told one of her friends that she had a dad and a stepdad, at which point she gestured proudly toward me. The little friend seemed slightly confused, but then she also rolled with it: &#x201c;cool,&#x201d; she said and turned to her mom: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s her stepdad,&#x201d; she explained. &nbsp;The mom looked at me; I looked at her and shrugged. &nbsp;Life is complicated, genders are complicated, families are complicated, and yet we have so few words for these new and often quite welcome complications that accompany massive social shifts. And so we make do. We let kids who have not yet learned the appropriate languages for indeterminate identities name what escapes adult comprehension.<br>&nbsp;<br>Children nowadays actually have a fantastically rich archive of wacky representations from which to draw as they make sense of their worlds. &nbsp;If SpongeBob SquarePants is anything to go by, and I believe he is, then children can find all kinds of examples of ambiguous embodiment in the materials that TV and cinema market to them. SpongeBob &nbsp;SquarePants &nbsp;and &nbsp;his crew of spongy life forms all experience a soft relation &nbsp;to reality, and while life in Bikini Bottom bears some resemblance&nbsp; to life above the water, &nbsp;it also operates according &nbsp;to its own set of rules, code violations,&nbsp;&nbsp;morality, and propriety. The villain of the piece is the money-grabbing Mr. Krabs, but SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick also often square off against a mean-spirited octopus named Squidward. The significance of SpongeBob SquarePants to contemporary gender norms,&nbsp; I believe, cannot &nbsp;be overstated; while earlier generations &nbsp;of boys and girls were raised &nbsp;on &nbsp;cartoon &nbsp;worlds&nbsp;&nbsp; populated &nbsp;by &nbsp;cats and &nbsp;mice, &nbsp;dogs &nbsp;and &nbsp;rabbit chasing each other across various domestic landscapes, this generation has come of age to an animated mythological universe populated by characters with eccentric and often simply weird relations to gender. &nbsp;And so we take SpongeBob SquarePants as our guide, following the hedonistic and cheerful sponge whose body, as he reminds one chap who sits on him, is also his face, in looking for fun, in mistrusting people who only want to make money, and in tracking down treats made with peanut butter.<br>&nbsp;<br>SpongeBob &nbsp;aside, &nbsp;this&nbsp; book &nbsp;tries &nbsp;to &nbsp;grapple &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;shifts and changes that have transformed the way we live our genders and sexualities &nbsp;over the last twenty years. While in universities, philosophers and queer theorists, including myself, have for years pondered the meaning of gender norms and studied the development of sexuality within matrices of normativity and perversity. We scholars don&#x2019;t always explicate clearly or accessibly. And that is unfortunate, &nbsp;because the fact is, this world within &nbsp;which &nbsp;we live, work, and love has changed &nbsp;dramatically since our parents raised us, and we all need a guide to the new social and emotional structures that&nbsp;support these changes. Just to name a few of the most obvious &nbsp;changes that have impacted &nbsp;our daily experiences of sex and gender, in the late twentieth century and early twenty- first century, we have seen a massive decline in the prevalence and dominance of monogamous marriage and a huge rise in divorce and &nbsp;diverse households. In the United States, we have also witnessed a new and startling visibility of transgender communities and individuals as well as new levels of acceptance for normative gays and lesbians. Gay marriage is on the horizon and the homo- hetero binary seems less definitive of sexual orientation than it did at the turn of the last century.<br><br>What has brought&nbsp; &nbsp;so many changes on and so quickly? The answer is: everything! In other words, change has occurred on account of the boom/bust economy; advances in computer technology; &nbsp;new medical research; increased mobility; new forms of social contact and social networking; new modes of media including Twitter feeds; new levels of media surveillance and intrusion and new forms of social control; etc., etc. Obviously, &nbsp;there is no need to pinpoint one singular narrative &nbsp;to account &nbsp;for the massive changes that &nbsp;we have experienced &nbsp;in our lifetimes; and in many ways, it would be weirder if our ideas of family, desire, the normal, &nbsp;the &nbsp;ordinary, the extraordinary did <i>not &nbsp;</i>change &nbsp;as everything else around &nbsp;us shifted, &nbsp;evolved, developed, &nbsp;and col- lapsed. That things change should neither surprise nor alarm us; it should&nbsp; <i>interest </i>us, however, &nbsp;and should&nbsp; engage us enough&nbsp; to spur &nbsp;a reconsideration of the terms, &nbsp;the names, &nbsp;the &nbsp;categories we use to understand our bodies, &nbsp;our relationships, our bonds with others, &nbsp;our connections to strangers, &nbsp;our intimacies within and beyond &nbsp;biological relation, &nbsp;and our imagination about &nbsp;the future. Change, indeed, is the air that children breathe, which may be why they are more flexible than adults.<br><br>But before I launch into a child-centric &nbsp;account &nbsp;of new genders, let me acknowledge that the child has all too often served as a justification &nbsp;for the most wretched &nbsp;forms of social and political conservatism &nbsp;in the United &nbsp;States since &nbsp;at least the mid- nineteenth&nbsp; &nbsp;century. &nbsp;A lesbian &nbsp;couple &nbsp;I &nbsp;know &nbsp;who &nbsp;live in San Francisco, &nbsp;just to give one example, became alarmed, &nbsp;after the birth &nbsp;of their &nbsp;daughter, about &nbsp;the amount &nbsp;of sexually &nbsp;explicit material &nbsp;in the shop windows &nbsp;in &nbsp;their &nbsp;very gay neighborhood, the Castro.&nbsp; Suddenly, the same environment that had made them feel excited about living in the city became the source of discomfort and concern. &nbsp;They quickly pulled up stakes and moved out to a suburb where the child would, according to them, be safe from the impact of openly displayed sexual materials. &nbsp;This is a couple &nbsp;that &nbsp;for years &nbsp;had &nbsp;engaged &nbsp;in a polyamorous &nbsp;relationship and &nbsp;had incorporated all kinds &nbsp;of sex toys &nbsp;into their &nbsp;sexlife. Suddenly, however, on behalf of their infant daughter, they rushed to avoid the very materials that had nurtured their own very queer desires. &nbsp;We all know &nbsp;of the &#x201c;protect &nbsp;the children&#x201d; ruses that &nbsp;religious Americans &nbsp;have used to censor all kinds of materials that feature any kind of open discussion of sexuality&#x2014; remember &nbsp;that &nbsp;in the 1970s &nbsp;Anita Bryant&nbsp; created &nbsp;a &#x201c;Save Our Children&#x201d; campaign &nbsp;that was designed to counteract a pro&#x2013;gay rights initiative in Florida, and this was followed in 1978 by the Briggs Initiative &nbsp;in &nbsp;California, which sought &nbsp;to ban &nbsp;gays and lesbians &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;classroom. &nbsp;Now &nbsp;that &nbsp;California &nbsp;has passed a &nbsp;resolution &nbsp;requiring &nbsp;that &nbsp;gay and &nbsp;lesbian &nbsp;history &nbsp;be taught in the schools, &nbsp;we can tell ourselves &nbsp;that &nbsp;we have traveled &nbsp;far from these paternalistic measures; &nbsp;and &nbsp;of course &nbsp;we &nbsp;have, &nbsp;but the problem &nbsp;is that &nbsp;the exact &nbsp;sex-negative attitudes that &nbsp;fueled antigay &nbsp;sentiment &nbsp;three &nbsp;decades &nbsp;ago now&nbsp;sneak&nbsp;new forms &nbsp;of sex negativity &nbsp;back into dynamic social systems&#x2014;but &nbsp;this time via gays and lesbians themselves!<br><br>While we currently train teenagers to think of sex in terms of all the bad things (pregnancy, &nbsp;sexual diseases) that could happen &nbsp;to them if they actually &#x201c;get lucky,&#x201d; many children are more wily and more canny than &nbsp;their parents &nbsp;think, &nbsp;and it is this generation of kids&#x2014;kids &nbsp;growing up in the age of divorce, &nbsp;queer parenting, and&nbsp;economic &nbsp;collapse&#x2014;who &nbsp;will probably &nbsp;recognize, name, and embrace new modes of gender and sexuality within a social environment that has changed their meaning forever.<br><br>Along these lines, let me give another illustration of the inventiveness of the child mind in relation to new material. My partner&#x2019;s son surprised me the other day. He caught me off guard. The conversation began as many others have, with him asking: &#x201c;Jack, can I ask you a question?&#x201d; &nbsp;The &nbsp;first&nbsp; time &nbsp;he&nbsp; used &nbsp;this approach, I was sure that &nbsp;some big life question &nbsp;would &nbsp;follow; or something &nbsp;about queerness, or sex, or something &nbsp;messy and unanswerable. But actually, &nbsp;the first few times that &nbsp;he used this lead-in, &nbsp;the question &nbsp;turned &nbsp;out to be about &nbsp;turtles, &nbsp;his favorite topic at that &nbsp;time (now it is octopuses; &nbsp;octopi?). &#x201c;Jack, can I ask you a question?&#x201d; such conversations typically go. &#x201c;Sure, shoot.&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, ah, hmm. How long do you think a turtle can live?&#x201d; OK, so on this day, I expected another turtle question and tried to line up some turtle facts. In fact, I had been reading up so as not to be caught off guard again: turtles have been on earth for about 200 million years. Turtles cannot leave their shells. Turtles can sometimes outrun humans (helpful to know!) . . . or stick their tongues out (less helpful) . . . they can, however, climb well (who knew?). Groups of turtles are called &#x201c;bales.&#x201d; That should cover it!<br><br>&#x201c;Shoot, ask me anything you like,&#x201d; I said blithely. &nbsp;And he did: &#x201c;Do you have a penis or . . .&#x201d; While I tried to grapple with the first part of the question, he continued seriously, trying to come up with the female equivalent of penis . . . &#x201c;or do you have, you know, a . . . well, the thing that girls have?&#x201d; He scrunched up his eyes as if he had just asked a very serious and important question about planetary motion or turtle mating habits. OK. A penis question &nbsp;. . . &#x201c;I have what girls have,&#x201d; I said quickly.&nbsp; Silence. And then: &#x201c;Well, then Jack, I hate to tell you this but you are basically a girl!&#x201d; True, I am basically a girl, how to respond to this while not giving up entirely on the truth of the &#x201c;boygirl&#x201d; moniker? &nbsp;Well, I didn&#x2019;t have to think too long. &nbsp;The little girl jumped in now, sensing that her older brother had reached the limits of his knowledge of such things. &#x201c;Of course he has a girl thing, <i>he </i>is a girl!&#x201d; Pause. &#x201c;A boygirl.&#x201d; &nbsp;She said this while looking at her brother as though he had just failed a spelling test. &#x201c;I know he is a girl,&#x201d; he answered quietly. &#x201c;I am just saying, does he have a penis or . . .&#x201d; I paused for a moment, wondering how to resolve this for him&#x2014;the mixture of pronouns and gender categories probably needed to be sorted out. Was this the time for<br><br>A quick lesson on gender, anatomy, and social meanings? Should I try to address the elephant (or turtle) in the room by raising the topics of lesbianism, transgenderism, cross-gender identification? Should I use as my example the little girl in his class who played with the boys and had recently declared girls&#x2019; games to be &#x201c;dumb&#x201d;? I began to answer the kids&#x2019; questions, thoughtfully and slowly . . . but, as it turns out, too slowly.&nbsp;The little guy got there first: &#x201c;Jack, can all turtles swim?&#x201d; he asked with great import. &nbsp;And just like that, the gender crisis had been raised; ad- dressed, and dispatched and we were back to the turtles.<br><br>Children are different from adults in all kinds of meaningful ways. They inhabit different understandings of time, and experience the passing of time differently. &nbsp;They also seamlessly transition between &nbsp;topics that &nbsp;adults &nbsp;would ordinarily not connect &nbsp;in polite conversation (turtles and sex, for example); and often, they place the emphasis differently than adults might by making questions about &nbsp;sex and gender as important or as inconsequential as questions &nbsp;about animals, vegetables, &nbsp;and minerals. &nbsp;The training of children is as much about teaching them where to place the emphasis as it is about giving them information. But the training &nbsp;of &nbsp;children &nbsp;would &nbsp;proceed &nbsp;much&nbsp; more &nbsp;smoothly &nbsp;if there &nbsp;were more exchange and if adults were willing, in the process, to be re- trained &nbsp;themselves. The whole notion of a generational exchange as a one-way process informs our ideas of parenting, and it keeps us stuck in profoundly limited and conservative models of the family and childrearing. If postmodern theory has taught us any- thing, it should have impressed upon us the idea that time is not linear and therefore that generational differences are more loopy and complex than we imagine when we plot them out along the straight lines of chronological age.

It determines whether we're trusting or suspicious, whether we're happy or discontent - and whether or not we can rely on God matters mightily on the day of our death. Mark Buchanan's third book continues his penetrating exploration of the God we worship. Bravely and honestly, he poses the direst question of human existence: Can God be trusted?<br><br><b>God Is _________. </b> <br><br>How do you describe the Creator of the universe, the Maker of your inmost being?

Educated at the University of British Columbia and Regent College, he has been published in numerous periodicals, including <b>Christianity Today </b>and <b>Books and Culture.</b>Lloyd James interprets the author's work with convincing clarity as he describes God's character, God's love for us, and God's desire to have a relationship with his creation. James's rich baritone, coupled with a delicate delivery and deft timing, reveals how to rest in the character of God. His voice is an excellent vehicle for Buchanan's descriptive, colorful words and clearly drawn examples. The author warns that resting in God requires trust and taking risks. Yet, he also advises, that is how faith in God is built. As we step out in faith, trusting God to respond, God honors our faithfulness and reveals Himself. James's delivery of Buchanan's message will inspire the listener into a deeper relationship with God.

As the physical therapist assigned to his recovery, she's finally getting the chance. But navy SEAL Michael Devaney is broken in body and spirit, and all he sees is himself&#x2014;as half a man. He's sure he'll never be enough for the beautiful and vibrant Kelly. Can Kelly convince him that he's all the man she would ever need?&nbsp;<br><br><b>Patrick's Destiny&nbsp;</b><br><br>Devastated by the discovery of a terrible family secret, Patrick Devaney has shut out the world. But enchanting kindergarten teacher Alice Newberry sees the hurt in his eyes and is determined to help Patrick find peace.

He eyed the sofa and debated whether its comfort was worth the effort it would take to heave himself out of the chair. Every damn day was filled with such inconsequential challenges. After years of trying to sort through the life-and-death logistics of SEAL missions, it grated on him that the simple decision of where to sit to watch another boring afternoon of television took on such importance.<br><br>"You want some help?" Ryan asked, his expression neutral.<br><br>Over the past few weeks, when his brother had been popping in and out of California on a regular basis, Michael had learned to recognize that look. It meant that Ryan was feeling sorry for him and was trying not to show it.<br><br>The attempt was pretty lame, but Ryan was actually better at it than Sean. Sean's obvious pity was almost more than Michael could take, which was one reason Ryan had been designated to pick him up at the airport and to help him settle into his new apartment.<br><br>Michael had discovered that the grown-up Ryan was a low-key kind of guy. He ran his own Irish pub and had settled into family life with a woman named Maggie who seldom took no for an answer. Michael had already had a few encounters with her on the phone and discovered she masked an iron will with sweet talk.<br><br>Sean, however, was a recently married firefighter, an active man who would have chafed at the restrictions on his life, just as Michael did. Maybe that was the reason that Sean couldn't seem to hide his sympathy each time he saw Michael in this damnable wheelchair. They probably needed to talk about it, but neither one of them had gotten up the nerve. Besides, what was there to say?<br><br>"I still don't know how I let you all talk me into moving back to Boston," Michael grumbled as he waved off Ryan's offer of help and struggled to move from the wheelchair to the sofa on his own. "There must be a foot of snow out there. In San Diego, I could be basking in the sunshine beside a pool."<br><br>"But you wouldn't be," Ryan said wryly. "The way I hear it, you hadn't set foot outside since you left the hospital."<br><br>Michael scowled. His brother clearly had too much information about his habits. There were only a handful of people who could have given it to him, most of them men Michael could have sworn were totally loyal to him.<br><br>"Who ratted me out?" he inquired testily.<br><br>Ryan held up his hands. "I've been sworn to secrecy. Your men seem to think you have a particularly nasty temper when crossed."<br><br>At least he could still intimidate <em>somebody,</em> Michael thought with satisfaction. It was a consolation. He certainly hadn't been able to intimidate Ryan's wife, Maggie, though.<br><br>Maggie was the one who'd called every single, blessed day pestering him to come East. She'd ignored his cranky responses, talked right over his blistering tirades and pretty much won him over with her silky sweet threats. He wondered if Ryan knew what a weapon he had living with him. Michael was convinced that Maggie Devaney could take over a small country if she was of a mind to. Michael could hardly wait to meet her in person, though he'd prefer to be in top-notch form when he did.<br><br>"Why didn't your wife come to the airport with you?" he asked his brother.<br><br>"She thought you might like a little time to yourself to get used to things," Ryan said. "She did send along a list of therapists for you to consider. She said you'd been discussing it, but hadn't agreed to hire one yet."<br><br>Michael frowned at the understatement. "Actually, what I told her was that I wasn't interested. I could have sworn I'd made that clear."<br><br>"You're content to spend the rest of your life in that wheelchair?" Ryan asked mildly.<br><br>"The doctors are the ones who consigned me to a wheelchair," Michael responded bitterly. The shattered bone in his thigh had taken two additional surgeries, and the doctors still weren't convinced it would ever heal properly. His knee was artificial. He felt like the Bionic Man, only one who'd gotten faulty parts.<br><br>Even if everything healed and worked, he'd never have the agility to return to the kind of work he loved. His navy career was definitely over. He'd declined the offer to push papers behind some desk at the Pentagon. Michael shuddered at the very thought-he'd rather eat raw squid. So he was twenty-seven and out of work and out of hope. He'd learn to live with it. .eventually.<br><br>Ryan leveled an uncompromising look straight at him. "Is that so? You're blaming this on the doctors? The way I hear it-"<br><br>"You apparently hear too damned much," Michael retorted. "Has it occurred to you that I was doing just fine before you and Sean-and your wives-came busting back into my life? I don't need you meddling now. If I decide to stay in Boston, I won't have all of you making me some sort of project." He leveled a daunting look of his own. "Are we clear on that?"<br><br>"No project," Ryan echoed dutifully.<br><br>Michael studied his brother with a narrowed gaze. That had gone a little too easily, he thought just as the doorbell rang. He scowled at Ryan. "You invite somebody else over?"<br><br>Ryan looked just the teensiest bit guilty. "It could be Maggie."<br><br>"I thought you said she was giving me some space."<br><br>Ryan shrugged. "Well, that's the thing with Maggie. She has her own ideas about how much space a man should have."<br><br>"Great. That's just great." Michael eyed his wheelchair with frustration. No way in hell could he haul himself back into the thing and get out of the room before Ryan opened the door. As curious as he was to see the woman who'd married his oldest brother, he wasn't ready for the meeting to take place today. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about it. He resigned himself to an early introduction to his sister-in-law.<br><br>Before he could catch his breath, Maggie burst into the room, her cheeks red, her eyes flashing and her hair like something from a painting of an auburn-haired goddess. No wonder his brother had fallen for her. Michael was half in love himself, but that was before he caught sight of the curly-haired toddler clutching her hand.<br><br>"This is Maggie," Ryan said unnecessarily. "And the pint-size replica is Caitlyn. She's just learned to walk, and she has only one speed-full throttle."<br><br>The warning came too late. Caitlyn took one look at Michael, broke free of her mother's grasp and hurtled straight toward him on her chubby, wobbly legs. She was about to grab his injured leg in her powerful little grasp when Michael instinctively bent forward and scooped her up.<br><br>Wide green eyes stared at him in shock. He expected immediate tears, but instead a slow smile blossomed on her little face, and he was an instant goner. He'd never realized a kid could steal a person's heart in less than ten seconds flat.<br><br>He sat her on his good leg. "Hiya, Caitlyn. I'm your Uncle Mike."<br><br>She studied him intently, then lifted a hand and patted his cheek.<br><br>"She's not saying too much yet," Maggie said, "but trust me, she knows how to make herself understood."<br><br>"Yeah, I can see that," Michael said, already thoroughly under little Caitlyn's spell.<br><br>"Think you can handle her for five minutes?" Maggie asked. "I have groceries in the car. I'm afraid I overdid it. I could use Ryan's help bringing them in."<br><br>"Sure. Miss Caitlyn and I will be fine." He wasn't sure how he knew that. It was just that it was the first time in months that someone wasn't looking at him with pity. His niece's expression was merely curious. He could deal with friendly curiosity, especially from someone who hadn't yet learned how to ask complete and probing questions.<br><br>But the instant Ryan and Maggie left, Michael had a sudden attack of nerves. He didn't know a whole lot about kids. He had dim memories of his twin brothers, but he'd been little more than a toddler himself when the family had split up. He'd been the youngest in his foster family. Now both of his foster sisters were married, but so far were childless. A couple of the guys on his SEAL team had children, but Michael had tended to steer clear of the gatherings when they'd been present. He didn't like the feelings of envy that washed through him when he was surrounded by tight-knit families.<br><br>"So, kid, what do you like to do?" he asked the toddler who seemed perfectly content to sit cuddled in his arms. "I'll bet you have a doll or two at home. Maybe a stuffed bear."<br><br>Caitlyn listened intently, but said nothing.<br><br>"Then, again, maybe you're one of those liberated little girls who has cars and trucks," Michael continued. "Your mom strikes me as the kind of woman who'd want you to grow up knowing that you have options."<br><br>Apparently he'd said the wrong thing, because Caitlyn suddenly looked around the room and huge tears promptly welled up in her eyes.<br><br>"Mama," she wailed loudly. "Mama!"<br><br>She sounded as if her little heart was breaking. Feeling desperate, Michael awkwardly patted her back. "Hey, it's okay. Your mama is just outside. She and your daddy will be right back."<br><br>That brought on a fresh round of tears. "Da-da-da!"<br><br>Michael was at a loss. He was about to panic, when the door swung open and Maggie and Ryan came breezing in. Maggie grinned, set the groceries beside the door and swooped in to pick up the squalling child.<br><br>"Hey, baby girl, what's all that noise?" Maggie chided.<br><br>Just like that, the wails trailed off and the tears stopped. "Mama," Caitlyn said contentedly, patting Maggie's cheek. Then she turned back to Michael and held out her arms.<br><br>Michael couldn't help chuckling. "Fickle little thing, aren't you?" he said as he reached for her. "You're going to grow up and break some man's heart."<br><br>"She won't be dating until she's at least thirty," Ryan said emphatically.<br><br>"Good plan. I can hardly wait to see how well you stick to it," Michael said. "Especially since this one obviously has a mind of her own already."<br><br>"Don't laugh. You might be called on to help me chase off the boys," his brother informed him.<br><br>Michael looked at the little angel who was now snuggled against him, half-asleep. "Just say the word," he said solemnly.<br><br>"That reminds me," Ryan said, taking a slip of paper from his pocket and handing it to Michael.<br><br>"What's this?"<br><br>"Maggie's list of therapists. She reminded me just now to be sure and give it to you."<br><br>Michael's gaze narrowed. "And the connection to your daughter's social life would be?"<br><br>"If you're going to help me protect Caitlyn from hormone-driven teenaged boys, you're going to have to be in top form," Ryan said. "You might as well pick one and call. If you don't, Maggie will."<br><br>Michael glanced toward the kitchen where his sister-in-law was busily arranging his groceries and dishes so things would be within reach. He took the list and stuffed it in his pocket without comment.<br><br>It was only later, after Ryan, Maggie and Caitlyn had gone, that he took out the paper and glanced at the names. One jumped out at him: Kelly Andrews.<br><br>Years ago his best friend, Bryan Andrews, had had a sister named Kelly. Was it possible that this was the same girl? He remembered her as being a cute, shy kid, but by now she would have to be, what? Twenty-four most likely.<br><br>Michael had lost touch with Bryan years ago. Maybe he'd track him down and ask if his sister was a physical therapist. Purely as a matter of curiosity. He had no intention of asking some therapist to waste her time on him, not when every doctor he'd seen had said that a full recovery was impossible.<br><br>And, he thought with self-derision, anything less meant he might as well be dead.<br><br>Kelly Andrews was as nervous as if she'd never worked with a patient before. She stood outside the small cluster of apartments in the freezing cold and tried to gather her courage. No matter how many times she told herself that Michael Devaney was a potential client, nothing more, she couldn't help the rush of emotions that filled her.<br><br>Michael had been her first teenage crush. Three years older than she was, he and her brother had been friends throughout high school. Michael had never given her so much as a second glance, not as anything more than Bryan's kid sister, anyway. That hadn't stopped her from weaving her share of fantasies about the quiet, dark-haired boy with the intense, brooding gaze and a body that even at seventeen had been impressively well muscled.<br><br>It was Bryan who'd told her about Michael being shot and the doctors' very real conviction that he would never walk, much less work as a SEAL, again. Bryan had come back from his visit with Michael sounding worried that his old friend was going to give up. That concern had communicated itself to Kelly.<br><br>"His brothers went out to San Diego and convinced him to come back here to recuperate," Bryan had explained two nights before. "I spoke to Ryan after I saw Michael. He says his brother is going to be needing a lot of physical therapy, but so far Michael has flatly refused to ask anyone for help. He did ask about you, though."<br><br>Kelly's heart had taken an unsteady leap. "He did?"<br><br>"Apparently your name was on a list Ryan's wife made of prospective therapists." Bryan had regarded her with a knowing look. "You interested? I know how you love a challenge. I also know you always had a thing for Michael."<br><br>"I did not," she said, though the flush in her cheeks was probably a dead giveaway that she was lying.<br><br>As desperately as she wanted to be the one to be there for Michael now, she had hesitated. "From what you say, it's going to be a long, difficult process. He's going to need someone he trusts. Do you think he'll pay any attention to me? In his mind, I'm probably still your kid sister."<br><br>Bryan had grinned. "Sis, you forget, I've seen you in action at the clinic when I've come by to pick you up. You're hard to ignore. So, should I tell his brother you'll take the job, and that you won't let Michael's lousy, uncooperative mood scare you off?"<br><br>"Hold it. Back up a minute. You said that before- something about brothers. I thought there were only girls in his family."<br><br>"The Havilceks only had girls, but Michael was a foster kid."<br><br>"Of course. I knew that," Kelly said, suddenly remembering. "At least, I knew he had a different last name. I guess I never really gave much thought to it, because he didn't seem to. So, these brothers are his biological brothers?"<br><br>Bryan had nodded. "He hadn't seen them in years till they turned up in San Diego."<br><br>"That must have been a shock."<br><br>"It was. They were separated when his parents bailed on all of them. Michael was only four. He barely remembered them."<br><br>She'd stared at her brother with surprise. "Is this something you just found out, or did you know it when we were kids?"<br><br>He shook his head. "I knew he was a foster kid. But back then, Michael never talked about how he'd wound up with the Havilceks. Every time I started to ask about his real family, he told me the Havilceks were his real family, the only one that counted."<br><br>The story explained a lot...and added to her fascination with Michael Devaney, a fascination she was going to have to ignore if she was going to do her job the way it needed to be done.<br><br></p><h2>An Imaginary Life</h2><p>In the first century A.D., Publius Ovidius Naso, the most urbane and irreverent poet of imperial Rome, was banished to a remote village on the edge of the Black Sea.

Mitch Pacwa and Sean Brown put all the confusion and anxiety to rest by answering the most common questions and objections to this indispensable sacrament.</p> <p>As humans, we have an innate desire to be at peace. Sin destroys this peace, leaving the soul in a weak and deprived state. In Go in Peace, the authors demonstrate that, through the power of confession, one is freed from the burden of sin and brought to peace with God and himself.</p> <p><b>You will learn:</b></p> <ul> <li>The biblical basis of confession</li> <li>Why Christ gave the Church the power to forgive sins</li> <li>Why this sacrament is required by the Church</li> <li>What elements are necessary for a good confession</li> <li>Why some sins require confession for forgiveness</li> <li>The psychological benefits of confession</li> <li>The spiritual benefits of confession</li></ul></p><p>Father Mitch Pacwa, S.J., was ordained to the priesthood in 1976. He holds a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy and theology from the University of Detroit, <i>summa cum laude,</i> master of divinity and S.T.B. degrees from the Jesuit School of Theology of Loyola University, magna cum laude, and a Ph.D. in Old Testament from Vanderbilt University.

They are proactively creating business models that bring their brand to life in the hearts and minds of their stakeholders. <i>Breakthrough Nonprofit Branding</i> demonstrates how a constituency-focused, compelling brand can revolutionize an organization and the way people view and support it. </p><p>As practiced in real life, most nonprofits define "branding" as their visual identity produced to aid in awareness and fundraising. However important logos and trademarks are, this limited perspective leaves a significant amount of value on the table. Visionary, mission-driven organizations recognize brand as a bigger canvas for their work. To them, branding is the daily expression of their purpose and a way to communicate their promise to stakeholders. Their brand is their trust mark&#x2014;their commitment to consistently deliver on who they are, what they stand for, and their unique benefits. </p><p>Drawing on their combined seventy plus years of experience in the nonprofit and corporate sectors, the authors studied eleven visionary nonprofits to reveal the seven principles for transforming a brand from ordinary trademark to strategic competitive advantage. The groups profiled reflect a variety of sizes, breadths, regions, and issues. The common thread is that their brand work has resulted in greater social impact and vibrant growth. </p><p>Through the use of case studies, <i>Breakthrough Nonprofit Branding</i> reveals how: </p><ul> <li>A nonprofit put its renewed brand to work to propel its organization forward&#x2014;despite inconsistent community support</li> <li>Renewed brand meaning heightened stakeholder commitment, stabilized an organization's financial position, and empowered it to weather a roiling economy</li> <li>A small organization's brand campaign resulted in exceptional growth</li> <li>A re-brand transformed a nonprofit, enabling it to expand from a regional to national footprint</li> <li>One of the largest nonprofits lost momentum and regained direction through a revitalized brand process</li> </ul> <p><i>Breakthrough Nonprofit</i> <i>Branding</i> shows you how to create a brand that creates unique value, builds deep relationships, fosters loyal communities, and increases social impact.

Syntax, the relationship of words to one another, forms, together with morphology, the material of grammar. Its relative importance varies according to the language considered. This is particularly true of word order, for when an inflected language loses its case endings, word order assumes many of the functions of the former cases. This outline by Professor Williams re-emphasizes the significance of word order in Hebrew. Developed over fifteen years in a formal course on Hebrew syntax at the University of Toronto, it treats the syntax of the noun, the verb, particles and clauses, with a selection of illustrative examples.

References are provided for further study.</p><p><p> The efficient transport of molecules is essential for the normal function of cells and organs and the design of devices for medical applications and biotechnology. <i>Transport Phenomena in Biological Systems</i> provides an introduction to the integrated study of transport processes and their biological applications. </p> <p> The book consists of four sections, which cover physiological fluid mechanics, mass transport, biochemical interactions and reactions and the effect of mass transfer, and transport in organs and whole organisms. In order to provide students with a firm understanding of biological transport processes, engineering concepts are provided within the context of specific biological problems. Examples and problems elaborate on the concepts in the text or develop new concepts. The introductory chapter presents a brief overview of transport processes at the cell and tissue level and relevant concepts in cell biology and physiology are presented throughout the text. An appendix provides an overview of relevant mathematical concepts used in the text. The problems at the end of each chapter require either analytical solution or numerical solution using MATLAB�. </p> <p> This book can be used for both introductory and advanced courses. Advanced topics covered include transport in the kidney, oxygen transport, receptor-mediated processes, cell adhesion, transport of drugs in tumors, and whole body pharmacokinetic models. References are provided for further study. </p><p> The transport of energy, mass, and momentum is essential to the function of living systems. Changes in these processes often underlie pathological conditions. Transport phenomena are also central to the operation of instrumentation used to analyze living systems, and to many of the technological interventions used to repair or improve tissues or organs. Transport processes are manifest from the smallest spatial scales of molecular dimensions to the large scales of whole organs and of organisms themselves. They also span the minute time scales of individual chemical events to the lifetimes of living systems. As scientific and technological advancements have shrunk the temporal and spatial scales of observation and understanding of living systems, attention to attendant transport processes at those scales has followed suit. </p> <p> The objective study of biological transport phenomena began historically in the field of physiology and, indeed, helped define that field. Today, the engineering application of biological transport phenomena contributes to research advances in physiology, immunology, and cell and molecular biology. Thus, transport processes are important considerations in basic research related to molecule, organelle, cell and organ function; the design and operation of devices, such as filtration units for kidney dialysis, high density cell culture and biosensors; and applications including rug and gene delivery, biological signal transduction, and tissue engineering. Clearly, attention to the basic mechanisms of transport processes and, concomitantly, their biological and biomedical contexts, is important to curricula for educating biomedical engineers. </p> <p> Teaching undergraduate and graduate students in bioengineering about transport phenomena in living systems is challenging. This teaching must integrate the development of fundamental principles of transport processes, the mathematical expression of these principles and the solution of transport equations, along with characterization of composition, structure and function of the living systems to which they are applied. The overwhelming majority of textbooks on transport processes are oriented primarily toward chemical and mechanical engineers, and lack applications and descriptions of biological and biomedical contexts. While many of these texts are excellent, there is a need for a book that integrates biological and engineering concepts in the development of the transport equations and, meanwhile, provides detailed and current applications. It is our goal that this text meets that need. </p> <p> The materials in this textbook will help to develop both skills and contextual knowledge for engineers, enabling them to establish and critically analyze models of biological transport and reaction processes. We have sought to present engineering fundamentals and biological contexts in a unified way. The book covers topics in fluid mechanics, mass transport, and biochemical interactions and reactions. Inclusion of the latter has great biological and biomedical motivation, since so many relevant processes and technologies involve chemical reactions. Each engineering concept is motivated by specific biological problems. Immediately after the concept is developed, biological and/or biomedical applications are presented. In this way, the student,4an gain an understanding of the specific topic presented, as well as its application to important problems in biology and medicine. Each chapter contains a number of examples and homework problems, that either elaborate upon problems discussed in the text or address new biomedical questions. Problems and examples include analytical as well as numerical solutions. We emphasize analytical solutions because they often provide physical insights that are important for introductory material, even if such insights provide only first-order levels of understanding. More complex problems that require numerical solution are presented and the use of MATLAB in the solution of these problems is discussed. References to current literature are provided for those who are interested in more detailed analyses. </p> <p> Our target audience consists of advanced undergraduates or graduate students. We assume some exposure to the study of biology, but Chapter 1 summarizes many basic concepts in cell biology and physiology. References to relevant texts in cell biology and physiology are provided. No previous exposure to mass and momentum transport, nor to chemical kinetics is assumed, but understanding of introductory material in chemistry is needed. Although students should be familiar with most of the mathematical concepts that are discussed in the text, we include an Appendix that provides a review of important concepts, and presents material about use of MATLAB in problem solving. </p> <p> The text contains an introduction and four parts. The introduction describes the motivation for the text and its organization and provides a brief overview of transport processes at the cell and tissue level. The first two parts are based on the analogy in development of principles for momentum and mass transport. Balance relations are presented for momentum (Chapter 2) and mass (Chapter 6), and are applied to some simplified biomedical contexts that demonstrate the effects of geometry and boundary conditions. Next, we develop the conservation and constitutive relations in three dimensions for momentum (Chapter 3) and mass (Chapter 7), and apply them to more complex problems. Subsequent chapters in each part are devoted to specific applications. The third part examines biochemical interactions and effects of mass transport upon these interactions. The fourth part focuses on transport in organs and whole organisms. Applications in all parts range from molecular events within cells (Chapters 11 and 12) to biochemical reactions that affect transport between cells (Chapters 13 to 15). The final chapter of the book synthesizes these concepts by considering several examples of whole-body transport. </p> <p> This book can be used for both introductory and advanced courses on transport phenomena in biomedical engineering. A one-semester course might include Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 10, and focus on the basic concepts of biological transport phenomena. We present physiological fluid mechanics before diffusion processes to provide a basis for understanding models describing the diffusion coefficient in Section 6.6. It is possible to present the analysis of diffusion (Chapter 6) prior to physiological fluid mechanics, by deferring discussion of Section 6.6 until low Reynolds number flow is presented. Time permitting, one or more of the application chapters could also be covered.

Working in a studio presided over by Claus Sluter, these sculptors created monuments for the ducal family that rivaled contemporary Italian works.</p><p>This stunning book provides an in-depth study of the twin summits of the achievement of these artists&#x2013;&#x2013;sculptures from the tombs of Philip the Bold (1342&#x2013;1404) and his son, John the Fearless (1371&#x2013;1419). These extraordinary marble and alabaster tombs serve as platforms for the ducal figures, who rest atop fully carved arcades. Within the spaces of the arcades, the artists carved individual monks in procession. Just over two feet high, each monk is a miniature embodiment of late medieval devotion. Shown in various states of mourning, they move in perpetual procession beneath the marble bodies of their rulers.</p><p>Accompanying the first major traveling exhibition of these recently restored sculptures, <i>The Mourners</i> illuminates the artistic sophistication and craftsmanship of these works.</p></p><p><b>Sophie Jugie</b> is director of the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts in Dijon.</p><h2>The Complete Pelican Shakespeare</h2><p>This major new complete edition of Shakespeare&#39;s works combines accessibility with the latest scholarship.

Included are reflections on cowboys, tractor-driving lessons, outhouses, ranch marriages, and family legacies.</p><p>Hearts of the West are unburdened in <i>Leaning into the Wind</i>, an anthology encompassing a wealth of experiences from farmers, ranchers, rangers, and other women who live and work in America's ofttimes harsh, sometimes beautiful high plains states shoehorned between the Mississippi and the Rockies. A New York newspaper writer transplanted to a hog farm on the "baking brown plains" sees a sagging trailer, rubbish, and waist-high weeds where her exuberant husband sees only promise. Waking on a bed of sweet straw after sobbing hysterically, she finds "dozens of piglets curled around me, nestled against my hips, tucked under my outspread arms, piled like a halo around my head." Other contributors wax poetic, describing an old pickup truck that "wanders down the road like a drunken goose" or steam coming off a newborn lamb in the chill night air.

Films can shape our perceptions-from relationships and careers to good and evil. They are often a window into the human soul, a glimpse that can be both terrifying and holy. <p>In view of the increasingly powerful role that movies play in our cultural dialogue, Robert K. Johnston, professor of theology and culture at Fuller Theological Seminary, has written a book to guide Christian moviegoers into a theological analysis of and conversation with film. Reel Spirituality: Theology and Film in Dialogue is the first title in the new Baker Academic series Engaging Culture. </p><p>Intended for use in the college and seminary classroom, Reel Spirituality helps Christians interpret movies through the eyes of faith. It provides the theological underpinnings for this art form and fosters both dialogue and discipleship. </p><p>Among the more than 200 movies Johnston cites are American Beauty, The Apostle, The English Patient, The Godfather, Life Is Beautiful, The Sound of Music, To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Truman Show. </p><p>The Engaging Culture series is designed to help Christians respond to our contemporary culture. Each volume will seek to explore particular cultural expressions with regards to God's presence in the world today and help readers become better involved in sympathetic dialogue and active discipleship.</p></p><p>"Robert Johnston has written the most comprehensive survey currently available on theology and film. . . . A must-read book for anyone interested in the rapidly expanding field of exploring the theological dimensions of contemporary film." -Robert Jewett, professor emeritus, Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary <p>"Reel Spirituality will not only help us develop a Christian wisdom about film; in turn, it will make us ask searching questions about the Christian faith and the way we express it. Throughout, the book is accessible and engaging. I commend it most warmly." -Jeremy Begbie, director, Theology through the Arts, University of Cambridge </p><p>"Reel Spirituality is a perceptive and provocative survey of why and how Christians . . . should take film seriously as a cultural force and as a vehicle for understanding how God keeps showing up in life-and in the movies." -Roy M. Anker, professor of English, Calvin College </p><p>"As a filmmaker, I am sometimes too close to my own movies and the process to step back and see the perspective of a movie's impact in our culture. That is what Rob does so insightfully. He is accurately describing the intersection of culture and Christianity-a vital issue not all Christians have embraced yet." -Ralph Winter, producer of Star Trek IV-VI and X-Men </p><p>"A lively and provocative dialogue that bridges the worlds of Christian truth and visual images. . . . Johnston guides his readers in seeing and understanding film from spiritual perspectives." -Terry Lindvall, professor of film, Regent University </p><p>"At various points in my life movies have been an evil to avoid, an entertainment to enjoy, a source of instruction to learn from. Rob Johnston's fine book now helps me understand why now movies allow me to see God at work in our world . . . and makes me long to see ever more clearly and deeply." -Leighton Ford, president, Leighton Ford Ministries</p>Robert K.

Sterrett received her first commission at the age of 19 (shortly after she was diagnosed with tuberculosis) from the Penn Publishing Company to illustrate Old French Fairy Tales (1920), a collection of works from the 19th-century French author, Comtesse de S�gur (Sophie Fedorovna Rostopchine)...... Tanglewood Tales for Boys and Girls (1853) is a book by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne, a sequel to A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys. It is a re-writing of well-known Greek myths in a volume for children. Overview: The book includes the myths of: Theseus and the Minotaur (Chapter : "The Minotaur") Antaeus and the Pygmies (Chapter: "The Pygmies") Dragon's Teeth (Chapter: "The Dragon's Teeth") Circe's Palace (Chapter: "Circe's Palace") Proserpina, Ceres, Pluto, and the Pomegranate Seed (Chapter: "The Pomegranate Seed") Jason and the Golden Fleece (Chapter: "The Golden Fleece") Hawthorne wrote introduction, titled "The Wayside", referring to The Wayside in Concord, where he lived from 1852 until his death. In the introduction, Hawthorne writes about a visit from his young friend Eustace Bright, who requested a sequel to A Wonder-Book, which impelled him to write the Tales. Although Hawthorne informs us in the introduction that these stories were also later retold by Cousin Eustace, the frame stories of A Wonder-Book have been abandoned. Hawthorne wrote the first book while renting a small cottage in the Berkshires, a vacation area for industrialists during the Gilded Age. The owner of the cottage, a railroad baron, renamed the cottage "Tanglewood" in honor of the book written there. Later, a nearby mansion was renamed Tanglewood, where outdoor classical concerts were held, which became a Berkshire summer tradition. Ironically, Hawthorne hated living in the Berkshires. The Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston was named after the book. The book was a favorite of Mary Catherine Farrington, the daughter of Tanglewood developer William Farrington. It reportedly inspired the name of the thickly wooded Tanglewood Island in the state of Washington............ Nathaniel Hawthorne ( born Nathaniel Hathorne; July 4, 1804 &#x2013; May 19, 1864) was an American novelist, dark romantic, and short story writer. He was born in 1804 in Salem, Massachusetts to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the Salem witch trials who never repented of his actions. He entered Bowdoin College in 1821, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in 1824, and graduated in 1825. He published his first work in 1828, the novel Fanshawe; he later tried to suppress it, feeling that it was not equal to the standard of his later work. He published several short stories in periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to Sophia Peabody. He worked at the Boston Custom House and joined Brook Farm, a transcendentalist community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment as consul took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to Concord in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children. Much of Hawthorne's writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral metaphors with an anti-Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories, and a biography of his college friend Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of the United States......</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to the Love of Wisdom: An Essential and Existential Approach to Philosophy</h2><p>The purpose of this engaging book is twofold: to explain and justify the primary objects and methods of the discipline of philosophy, and to show how philosophy is relevant to a person&#39;s life and happiness.</p><p><b>James A.

This period was one of the most critical in the history of the Mediterranean world. It begins with the establishment of the Severan dynasty as a result of civil war. From AD 235 this period of relative stability was followed by half a century of short reigns of short-lived emperors and a number of military attacks on the eastern and northern frontiers of the empire. This was followed by the First Tetrarchy (AD 284-305), a period of collegial rule in which Diocletian, with his colleague Maximian and two junior Caesars (Constantius and Galerius), restabilised the empire. The period ends with the reign of the first Christian emperor, Constantine, who defeated Licinius and established a dynasty which lasted for thirty-five years.</p><p>This volume offers an authoritative and up-to-date account of the history of the Roman Empire from AD 193 to 337.

The care of injured wildlife brought into veterinary practices is often inadequate due to lack of knowledge. Wildlife casualties present an enormous range of species and conditions not normally seen in veterinary practice. <p>This book describes how to handle and provide first aid, how to feed and release, and many other disciplines not featured in veterinary or nursing training. It lays out in a clear and simple fashion the support services that the veterinary nurse or rehabilitator can provide to assist the veterinary surgeon. The more common diseases where prophylactic treatments can easily be directed by a veterinary surgeon are included, as well as simple stabilisation techniques that can often be adopted to prevent pain and suffering and provide a long-term treatment of choice.</p></p><p>Wildlife care and rehabilitation is often on a one-to-one basis and involves a lot of time, care and skill. However, for many years, care of injured wildlife was regarded as a low priority and euthanasia was the recommended option. A lot has changed over the past twenty years and now caring for wildlife casualties is part of everyday life in many veterinary practices. Following on from the major success of the first edition, this second edition provides even more useful information on wildlife care and rehabilitation. As well as covering a whole range of species, with sections on birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, this edition now includes information on many &#39;alien&#39; species appearing in the British countryside such as wallabies, wild boar and exotic reptiles. in this edition: Essential guidance on handling, first aid, feeding and releasing, and many other disciplines not featured in veterinary or nursing training; Full of helpful tips from an expert in wildlife rehabilitation who has unparalleled practical experience; Expanded chapters on the care of all species - particularly casualty badgers, otters and hedgehogs - and more comprehensive guidance on rearing orphaned mammals and birds; Lots more colour pictures to aid in management and care techniques and the latest information on zoonotic diseases from around the world.Les Stocker MBE is Founder of St Tiggywinkles Wildlife Teaching Hospital Trust, Europe&#x2019;s first wildlife teaching hospital.

These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine&#39;s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy.&#39; Considered the most light-hearted and satirical of Austen&#39;s novels, Northanger Abbey tells the story of an unlikely young heroine Catherine Morland. While staying in Bath, Catherine meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor who invite her to their family estate, Northanger Abbey. A fan of Gothic Romance novels, naive Catherine is soon letting her imagination run wild in the atmospheric abbey, fuelled by her friendship with the vivacious Isabella Thorpe. It is only when the realities of life set in around her that Catherine&#39;s fantastical world is shattered. A coming-of-age novel, Austen expertly parodies the Gothic romance novels of her time and reveals much about her unsentimental view of love and marriage in the eighteenth century.</p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>Mystery Babylon: Unlocking the Bible&#39;s Greatest Prophetic Mystery</h2><p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Joel Richardson carefully explores what is arguably the greatest prophetic mystery in all of the Bible.</p><p></p><p>Mystery Babylon is an in-depth look at the prophecy of Revelation 17 and 18. Richardson dissects the longest prophecy in the New Testament &#x2013; the final chapters of the Bible &#x2013; in order to make sense of these deeply elusive and profoundly controversial passages.</p><p></p><p></p><p>At once a queen, a prostitute, and a cold-blooded killer, this great harlot waves a golden cup filled with blood. Adorned in purple and scarlet and gold and precious stones, she seduces the kings of the earth with luxury. Most commonly known, perhaps, is that she rides a beast with seven heads and ten horns. Her title is Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of all harlots and of the abominations of the earth.</p><p></p><p>From the early days of Christianity, believers have struggled to understand the mystery of the great harlot. Scholars and students alike have arrived at many different conclusions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In his characteristically easy-to-understand style, Richardson works through the history of Christian interpretation of Mystery Babylon, weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each view, making a powerful case for a solution to this prophecy that will rock the prophecy world.</p></p><p><p><b>Joel Richardson </b>is the author of several books including the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Islamic Antichrist</i>: <i>The Shocking Truth About the Real Nature of the Beast.</i> He also wrote <i>Mideast Beast</i> and is the director of the WND Films documentary <i>End Times Eyewitness</i>. He is an internationally recognized expert on biblical prophecy, the Middle East, and Islam and is a human rights activist and a commentator for WND.</p>Once again, Joel Richardson has shaken the foundations of the prophecy world and just about everything we thought we knew about Mystery Babylon. This highly original and thought-provoking book just may provide the solution to this age-old mystery that we have been searching out for millennia. --Tom Horn, best-selling author, CEO, SkyWatch TV<br><br>Once again, best selling author Joel Richardson connects the geo-political and prophetic dots and presents a compelling, straightforward, and redemptive case for one of the Bible's most enigmatic prophecies. If you want to understand the times like the Sons of Issachar, I heartily recommend Joel's latest excellent work! --Marvin J. Rosenthal, Executive Director, Zion's Hope<br><br>Joel Richardson has provided us with an important and very systematic work, laying out the possibilities of who or what is the identity of "Mystery Babylon."

In under an hour, fifty-two members of Heald&#x2019;s party were killed, and the rest were taken prisoner; the Potawatomi then burned Fort Dearborn before returning to their villages.</p>These events are now seen as a foundational moment in Chicago&#x2019;s storied past. With <i>Rising up from Indian Country</i>, noted historian Ann Durkin Keating richly recounts the Battle of Fort Dearborn while situating it within the context of several wider histories that span the nearly four decades between the 1795 Treaty of Greenville, in which Native Americans gave up a square mile at the mouth of the Chicago River, and the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, in which the American government and the Potawatomi exchanged five million acres of land west of the Mississippi River for a tract of the same size in northeast Illinois and southeast Wisconsin.&nbsp;In the first book devoted entirely to this crucial period, Keating tells a story not only of military conquest but of the lives of people on all sides of the conflict. She highlights such figures as Jean Baptiste Point de Sable and John Kinzie and demonstrates that early Chicago was a place of cross-cultural reliance among the French, the Americans, and the Native Americans. Published to commemorate the bicentennial of the Battle of Fort Dearborn, this gripping account of the birth of Chicago will become required reading for anyone seeking to understand the city and its complex origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Ann Durkin Keating</b> is the Dr. C.

Hoxie, author of The People: A History of Native America)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Rising Up from Indian Country</i> is a masterful study of Chicago&#x2019;s founding story. Ann Durkin Keating displays her ample skills as a historian, tackling the city&#x2019;s frontier experience and exploring the roles of the major players, especially those of John Kinzie and of Native Americans during this complex early period. She has cut through the fog of legend to give us a valuable look at Chicago when it was still Indian Country.&#x201d;<br> (Dominic A.

Francis D.K. Ching&#x2019;s integrated approach to the subject is reflected in the functional value and decorative beauty of the work itself, which is hand-lettered and richly illustrated by the author. Beginning with the definition and characteristics of architectural space, Mr. Ching discusses the structuring and formation of interior space in three dimensions. He then demonstrates how functional needs can be translated into design decisions; outlines the basic elements and principles of visual design as they are applied to interior design; and explores the functional, aesthetic, and expressive roles such elements can play in the development of three-dimensional space. Finally, he discusses the systems necessary for our environmental health, safety, comfort, and convenience that must be integrated into a building&#x2019;s structure as well as the design of its interior. The range of illustrations is intended not only to communicate visual information but also to provide fertile ground for insight and creative action. Not only will beginning interior design students find this book invaluable for its concise and accessible presentation of important concepts, but more experienced practitioners &#x2014; especially architects concerned with the relationship between building structure and interior space &#x2014; will benefit from Mr. Ching&#x2019;s novel approach.Francis D.K.

Although long admired, the terracotta models have never been the subject of detailed examination. This publication presents a wealth of new discoveries (including evidence of the artist's fingerprints imprinted on the clay), resolving lingering issues of attribution while giving readers a vivid sense of how the artist and his assistants fulfilled a steady stream of monumental commissions. Essays describe Bernini's education as a modeler; his approach to preparatory drawings; his use of assistants; and the response to his models by 17th-century collectors. Extensive research by conservators and art historians explores the different types of models created in Bernini's workshop.

He was educated locally and at London University, before working initially as a solicitor&#x2019;s clerk, but soon turned to writing popular serial fiction and editing a women&#x2019;s magazine. After the publication of his first novel, &#x2018;A Man from the North&#x2019; in 1898 he became a professional writer and some of his best and most enduring and acclaimed work, including &#x2018;Anna of the Five Towns&#x2019;, &#x2018;The Old Wives' Tale&#x2019;, &#x2018;Clayhanger&#x2019;, &#x2018;The Card&#x2019; and &#x2018;Hilda Lessways&#x2019; followed over the next twelve years. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, Bennett was invited to join the War Propaganda Bureau, concerned with finding ways of best promoting Britain's interests. He was in good company, as others who contributed to this effort included Conan Doyle, John Masefield, G. K. Chesterton, Sir Henry Newbolt, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Gilbert Parker, G. M. Trevelyan and H. G. Wells. Bernard Shaw knew nothing of the Bureau, but attacked what he believed to be jingoistic articles and poems being produced by British writers. Bennett was the one chosen to defend their actions. He served on a War Memorial Committee at the invitation of the then Minister of Information, Lord Beaverbrook, and was also appointed director of British propaganda in France. His spells in Paris added to his reputation as a man of cosmopolitan and discerning tastes. After the War he inevitably returned to writing novels and also became a director of the &#x2018;New Statesman&#x2019;. Bennett&#x2019;s great reputation is built upon the success of his novels and short stories set in the Potteries, an area of north Staffordshire that he recreated as the &#x2018;Five Towns&#x2019;. &#x2018;Anna of the Five Towns&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Old Wives&#x2019; Tale&#x2019; show the influence of Flaubert, Maupassant and Balzac as Bennett describes provincial life in great detail. Arnold Bennett is an important link between the English novel and European realism. He wrote several plays and lighter works such as &#x2018;The Grand Babylon Hotel&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Card&#x2019;.

Here we are in 1880 darkest but British Africa as portrayed in old movies, plays and novels. Only with a difference. Both parody and spoof of the Victorian Empire and its rigid attitudes especially towards sex. There is Clive, a British functionary, his wife Betty (played by a man), their daughter Victoria (a rag doll), Clive's friend Harry an explorer, Mrs. Saunders who runs about dressed in a riding habit, Clive's son Edward who still plays with dolls and is played by a woman and Joshua a native servant who knows exactly what is really going on. What really is going on is a marvelous send up and a non-stop round robin of sexual liaisons. All this time the natives are restless in the background. The second act shifts to London in 1980 except for the surviving characters it is only twenty five years later and all those repressed sexual longings have evaporated along with the Empire. </p><p>"Intelligent, inventive and funny."-The New York Times </p><p>"I really don't know when I've had more fun.

It covers the emergence of Turkey over two centuries, from the decline and collapse of the Ottoman Empire up to the present day. In a new chapter, Lewis discusses the origins of his book in the Cold War era and the events that have taken place since its first publication in 1961.

Although we often think of routines as being used for organization, routines can also be used to enhance instruction. In this book, the authors present seven easily implemented mathematical routines that may be used effectively at a variety of grade levels and with a variety of mathematical content. The book also includes ideas for infusing mathematics into the nonmathematical routines that take time away from instruction.<br><br> Each chapter begins with classroom vignettes that provide a glimpse of how the routine might look as it is implemented in a variety of grade levels. A description of the routine and implementation strategies follow and the authors provide examples of student work from various grade levels for each of the routine, including examples of ways to assess student thinking by using the routines, and suggestions for adapting the routines. The book includes connections to the Common Core practice standards and focuses on creating opportunities for differentiated instruction.<br><br> A highly useful book, written by seasoned mathematics educators, this book is a must-have for all elementary and middle school mathematics teachers.</p><p>Ann McCoy is an associate professor of mathematics education at the University of Central Missouri where she teaches mathematics content and methods courses for prospective elementary and middle school teachers.

There is, however, increasing evidence that even after such differences are accounted for, race and ethnicity remain significant predictors of the quality of health care received.</p> <p>In <i>Unequal Treatment</i>, a panel of experts documents this evidence and explores how persons of color experience the health care environment. The book examines how disparities in treatment may arise in health care systems and looks at aspects of the clinical encounter that may contribute to such disparities. Patients' and providers' attitudes, expectations, and behavior are analyzed.</p> <p>How to intervene? <i>Unequal Treatment</i> offers recommendations for improvements in medical care financing, allocation of care, availability of language translation, community-based care, and other arenas. The committee highlights the potential of cross-cultural education to improve provider-patient communication and offers a detailed look at how to integrate cross-cultural learning within the health professions. The book concludes with recommendations for data collection and research initiatives. <i>Unequal Treatment</i> will be vitally important to health care policymakers, administrators, providers, educators, and students as well as advocates for people of color.</p> Table of Contents<br><ul><li>Front Matter</li><li>Summary</li><li>1 Introduction and Literature Review</li><li>2 The Healthcare Environment and Its Relation to Disparities</li><li>3 Assessing Potential Sources of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care: Patient- and System-Level Factors</li><li>4 Assessing Potential Sources of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care: The Clinical Encounter</li><li>5 Interventions: Systemic Strategies</li><li>6 Interventions: Cross-Cultural Education in the Health Professions</li><li>7 Data Collection and Monitoring</li><li>8 Needed Research</li><li>References</li><li>Appendixes</li><li>A Data Sources and Methods</li><li>B Literature Review</li><li>C Federal-Level and Other Initiatives to Address Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Healthcare</li><li>D Racial Disparities in Healthcare: Highlights from Focus Group Findings</li><li>E Committee and Staff Biographies</li><li>Paper Contributions</li><li>Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Diagnosis and Treatment: A Review of the Evidence and a Consideration of Causes - H.

Smedley, Adrienne Y. Stith, and Alan R. Nelson, Editors, Committee on Understanding and Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health CareThe life expectancy of members of most minority groups in the United States is shorter than it is for white Americans. For example, the gap in life expectancy between black Americans and white Americans is about six years. Against this bleak backdrop, a group of scholars assembled by the Institute of Medicine has taken on the issue of racial disparities in health care. In Unequal Treatment, they deal with several questions. In the United States, are there disparities in treatment between patients who are members of minority groups and those who are not, when both groups have similar access to care? If so, can we determine what underlies these disparities and what we should do about them? The medical literature reviewed in this book should convince even skeptics that members of minority groups receive treatment for their health problems that is different from the treatment received by others. However, determining whether these differences exist when all patients have equal access to care is a thornier issue. Two approaches are commonly used to analyze this problem: one is to examine the treatment of patients at a single location; the other is to investigate the treatment of patients who have the same insurance. Unfortunately, both of these experimental designs fall short of the ideal condition, in which all patients have equal access to the same range of services and expertise. As a result, no one can be certain whether disparities in treatment reflect unequal treatment of two groups of patients with equal access to health care or unequal treatment of two groups owing to a difference in resources, such as the availability of subspecialists and well-stocked pharmacies. After careful consideration of the evidence, the editors favor the former explanation: unequal treatment despite equal access. They ground this view in well-described and engaging theories about the roles of race, nonverbal communication, and inferential thinking that invisibly alter the clinical encounter between a patient who is a member of a minority group and a physician who is not. They conclude that "stereotyping, biases, and uncertainty on the part of the healthcare providers can all contribute to unequal treatment." This conclusion is important and remarkable, in that it redefines the problem of disparities in health care as a problem not of uneven access but of moral failure. In this context, the editors' recommendations make sense. Poor treatment of minorities should be considered an abrogation of civil rights. Doctors' understanding of their minority patients should be enhanced through educational programs on disparities in treatment and on cultural competency. The medical profession's myopia regarding minority issues should be addressed by enriching the physician workforce with more members of minority groups. I believe, however, that if we focus our attention on eliminating racial disparities, we will fall short of our aspirations. Decades of research have shown that the care received by patients who do not belong to a minority group is also frequently of poor quality, meaning that by aiming for parity we aim too low. An alternative is to focus purely on maximizing the quality of care received by underserved populations. Our success in this endeavor would be reflected within these communities, rather than measured by comparison with other populations. We could provide additional reimbursement to physicians who treat underserved patients, rather than threaten them with charges of civil-rights violations. In England, the National Health Service has experimented successfully with a deprivation payment system. According to this system, general practitioners who work in underprivileged areas of the country receive additional reimbursement for the care they provide, in part on the premise that the barriers to providing optimal care are greater in such areas. We could also target the specific conditions that most impair health and economic viability in minority communities. Currently, childhood asthma is rampant in inner cities and has severe economic consequences for affected families: every exacerbation requires both the child and the caregiver to stay at home, thus impeding the child's educational success and the adult caregiver's professional success. Harlem Hospital, in New York City, has engaged in intensive community outreach that has mitigated the burden imposed by this condition. If our aim is to follow Harlem Hospital's lead on a larger scale, it will be better served by educating doctors about the strong relation between poverty and environment than by educating them about the relatively weak relation between skin color and treatment preferences. These alternative approaches could have received more consideration in this engaging book. <i>Peter B. Bach, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2003 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

How do peoples and nations define themselves and perceive foreigners? Questions like these serve as the framework for <em>The Ancient Mediterranean World: From the Stone Age to A.D. 600</em>. This book provides a concise overview of the history of the Mediterranean world, from Paleolithic times through the rise of Islam in the seventh century A.D. It traces the origins of the civilizations around the Mediterranean--including ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Rome--and their interactions over time. <br> <em>The Ancient Mediterranean World</em> goes beyond political history to explore the lives of ordinary men and women and investigate topics such as the relationships between social classes, the dynamics of the family, the military and society, and aristocratic values. It introduces students not only to the ancient texts on which historians rely, but also to the art and architecture that reveal how people lived and how they understood ideas like love, death, and the body. Numerous illustrations, chronological charts, excerpts from ancient texts, and in-depth discussions of specific art objects and historical methods are included. Text boxes containing primary source materials examine such diverse subjects as warfare in early Mesopotamia, sculpting the body in classical Greece, the young women of Sappho's chorus, and early descriptions of the Huns. Combining excellent chronological coverage with a clear, concise narrative, <em>The Ancient Mediterranean World</em> is an ideal text for undergraduate courses in ancient history and ancient civilization.<br></p><p>Robin W.

The Journal of Classics Teaching</p><h2>The Charterhouse of Parma (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>More than any other nineteenth-century writer, Stendhal was imbued with the spirit of the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath, and this spirit gives <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i>, the masterpiece he published in 1839, a freshness and radical originality we normally associate with the great texts of the twentieth century. Remarkable for its detail, its political prescience, and the far-reaching psychological insight with which its characters and their passions are developed, this picture of the intricate intrigues at the court of a small Italian duchy illuminates, through its intense concentration on local events, a whole epoch of European history.</p><p>(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)</p></p><p>Officer, diplomat, spy, journalist, and intermittent genius, Marie Henri Beyle employed more than 200 aliases in the course of his crowded career. His most famous moniker, however, was Stendhal, which he affixed to his greatest work, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i>. The author spent a mere seven weeks cranking out this marvel in 1838, setting the fictional equivalent of a land-speed record. To be honest, there are occasional signs of haste, during which he clearly bypassed <i>le mot juste</i> in favor of narrative zing. So what? Stendhal at his sloppiest is still wittier, and wiser about human behavior, than just about any writer you could name. No wonder so meticulous a stylist as Paul Val�ry was happy to forgive his sins against French grammar: "We should never be finished with Stendhal. I can think of no greater praise than that."<p> The plot of <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> suggests a run-of-the-mill potboiler, complete with court intrigue, military derring-do, and more romance than you can shake a saber at. But Stendhal had an amazing, pre-Freudian grasp of psychology (at least the Gallic variant). More than most of his contemporaries, he understood the incessant jostling of love, sex, fear, and ambition, not to mention our endless capacity for self-deception. No wonder his hero, Fabrizio de Dongo, seems to know everything and nothing about himself. Even under fire at the Battle of Waterloo, the young Fabrizio has a tendency to lose himself in Napoleonic reverie: </p><blockquote>Suddenly everyone galloped off. A few moments later Fabrizio saw, twenty paces ahead, a ploughed field that seemed to be strangely in motion; the furrows were filled with water, and the wet ground that formed their crests was exploding into tiny black fragments flung three or four feet into the air. Fabrizio noticed this odd effect as he passed; then his mind returned to daydreams of the Marshal's glory. He heard a sharp cry beside him: two hussars had fallen, riddled by bullets; and when he turned to look at them, they were already twenty paces behind the escort.</blockquote> The quote above, a famous one, captures something of Stendhal's headlong style. Until now, most English-speaking readers have experienced it via C.K. Scott-Moncrieff's superb 1925 translation. But now Richard Howard has modernized his predecessor's period touches, streamlined some of the fussier locutions, and generally given Stendhal his high-velocity due. The result is a timely version of a timeless masterpiece, which shouldn't need to be updated again until, oh, 2050. Crammed with life, lust, and verbal fireworks, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> demonstrates the real truth of its creator's self-composed epitaph: "He lived. He wrote. He loved." <i>--James Marcus</i>Richard Howard's exuberant and definitive rendition of Stendhal's stirring tale has brought about the rediscovery of this classic by modern readers. Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history.

Now, through winsome "fables" about concepts that are relevant to the very youngest math learners -- sharing, teamwork, etc. -- Greg encourages kids to see the basics of addition and subtraction in entirely new ways. Fresh, fun, and most of all, inspiring, MATH FABLES is perfect for launching young readers on the road to math success!</p><p>School Library Journal<br>(March 1, 2004; 0-439-45399-2)<br><br>PreS-Gr 1-Complete with catchy titles such as "Trying Times," "Midnight Snack," and "Gone with the Wind," each brief fable told in rhyme ends with a moral. Except for some suggested activities at the end, there are no math problems or puzzles to solve. Rather, the author strives to help readers learn how to see a number as a combination of smaller groups of numbers in order to lay "the foundation for place value" and as a "first step to building strong computational skills." The text and perky, computer-generated cartoons show youngsters that there are many different ways of putting numbers together. For example, in "Going Nuts," four squirrels frolic in autumn leaves until they realize they need provisions for winter. One begins to explore while three sit on a branch, frightened with worry. Next, "2 squirrels raced to gather nuts" while "the other 2- buried them in stashes underground." Finally, "all 4 slept very well that night,/no longer feeling scared./They learned it's wise to plan ahead/and always be prepared!" Cahoon keeps the different combinations together by enclosing them in ovals, visually emphasizing that although the groupings may look different, they still add up to four. Featuring words like "sultry," "wholeheartedly," and "procrastinate," the enriching vocabulary is an added bonus.

Continuing to make arithmetic fun, Math Fables by Greg Tang, illus. by Heather Cahoon, offers 10 rhymes about animals that teach a life lesson while demonstrating basic addition. For the number seven, "Gone with the Wind" traces the path of monarch butterflies to Mexico, using every possible combination of addends (5+2; 6+1; etc.): "Their journey would be very far,/ a thousand miles or more./ The monarchs flew both day and night/ in groups of 3 and 4." In addition, Tang extends readers' vocabulary ("albeit," "prudent," "sultry"). Cahoon's computer-generated illustrations once again bring personality and charm to the animals and settings.

As he did in Math Appeal BKL F 15 03, Tang introduces children to the wonders of grouping numbers. Each fable tells a rhyming story in a two- or four-page spread, with each setup more complex than the last. One of the first fables tells of two young birds. One bird takes wing and hits the ground, and the other one falls from the sky and nearly drowns. When the birds practice together, however, they both learn to fly. In another story, 10 beavers leave for work, regrouping and reorganizing their numbers all day. A final page offers ideas to help more accelerated learners combine groups of numbers in various ways. The bright, shiny artwork, executed on a computer, sometimes appears literally rough around the edges, but the target audience will like the illustrations' happy cartoon look. Like Tang's other books, this will engage children, who may not even realize they are learning. --Ilene Cooper Copyright 2004 Booklist<br>PreSchool-Grade 1--Complete with catchy titles such as "Trying Times," "Midnight Snack," and "Gone with the Wind," each brief fable told in rhyme ends with a moral.

No other figure in contemporary history is associated with such far-reaching historical impact and such monstrous crimes. His name alone is emblematic of world war and Holocaust. If only because of the barbarity for which he is responsible, Adolf Hitler has become an anxiety neurosis, a vision of horror. And that is why he remains even now as he was to many of his contemporaries: an incomprehensible mystery. In the half century since his death, he has been the subject of over 120,000 publications, and yet the historian John Lukacs, who has tried to impose some sort of order on the chaotic jumble, comes to the significant conclusion that "We are far from done with Hitler."What Hitler did in history has been amply documented in the monumental work of historians and biographers such Alan Bullock, Joachim Fest, Hans Mommsen and Ian Kershaw. Who Hitler was, however, as a person, what anchored him emotionally, has either eluded or been of little interest to writers who often burden themselves with the search for the origin of his evil as the explanation for his life and its consequences. Drawing from a wealth of archival sources, much of which has been long overlooked by historians, The Hidden Hitler focuses on Hitler the man. Lothar Machtan's controversial thesis is that Adolf Hitler was homosexual, and that one cannot begin to understand him, his entry into politics, and the early Nazi movement without a clear understanding of this aspect of his identity. The Hidden Hitler documents the homosexual milieu in which the young Hitler lived and thrived from his early years in Vienna, through the beginnings of his political career in Munich, and during his years as the F�hrer. Machtan documents a succession of homosexual and homosexually inclined men among Hitler's most intimate friends and supporters, including August Kubizek, Rudolf H&#x2030;usler, Reinhold Hanisch, Ernst Schmidt, Ernst R&#x2c6;hm, Dietrich Eckart, Rudolf Hess, Emil Maurice, "Putzi" Hanfstaengl and Kurt Ludecke. Of these, Eckart and R&#x2c6;hm were pivotal to his entry into politics. Machtan also unearths surprising new documents that attest to Hitler's homosexuality in those early years. Of particular importance is the "Mend Protocol," portions of which appear for the first time in this book. While it is doubtful that Hitler was sexually active in any way (gay or straight) after 1933, his homosexual past, nevertheless, was his Achilles' heel. It threatened him politically and left him open to blackmail by his most intimate associates. The assasination of Ernst R&#x2c6;hm, along with roughly 150 other men over a four day period in 1934, served as a chilling message to all with knowledge, or access to knowledge, about the F�hrer's past life.Recent books on the Nazi movement have argued that the Third Reich was a fundamentally sordid regime. Machtan provides powerful new evidence in support of this view. This side of Hitler and his "Munich clique," as Goebbels put it, has never been so vividly evoked. As an intimate portrait of Hitler and as a surprising portrait of the homoerotic nature of the early Nazi movement, The Hidden Hitler is a major and certainly controversial contribution to the biographical literature. Anyone who has read any previous biographer of Adolf Hitler will read The Hidden Hitler and wonder, "how could they have missed entirely the homosexuality of Hitler and his entourage?"</p><p>The historian Lothar Machtan was born in 1949, got his PhD in 1978 and became a professor in 1989. He is an associate professor of Modern and Current History at Bremen University in Germany.

Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>.

She has refused to give out the slightest hint as to the manner of her brother&#x2019;s sudden death. Granton Sayers died in his Santa Bar�bara mansion two days ago, on the night of May 3rd.

It would be interesting to know where that enchanting siren of the screen was on the night of May 3rd&#x2014;after dinner. Or where she has been ever since. And if&#x2014;as Miss Frederica Sayers maintains--there is nothing to whisper about, why are there such persistent rumors linking that certain famous name with the death of the great oil king of the West?

He drove down a crowded street of little shops, shrunken and dried in the sun, with dusty window panes ready to push one another out of the tight, grim row. Behind the panes he could see everything men needed, every�thing they lived for: stiff dresses with rhinestone butterflies, jars of strawberry jam and cans of tomatoes, floor mops and lawn mowers, cold cream and aspirin and a famous cure for gas in the stomach. Men&nbsp;passed by, weary, hurried, indifferent, hair sticking to hot, wet fore�heads. And it seemed as if the greatest of human miseries was not of those who could not afford to enter the shops and buy, but of those who could.</p><p>Over a little movie theater with a yellow brick front, a blank mar�quee, and a circle bearing a huge 15 cents in tarnished tinsel, stood the cardboard figure of a woman. She stood erect, her shoulders thrown back, and her short blond hair was like a bonfire snapped at the height of a furious storm&#x2014; ferocious tangle of hair over a slim body. She had pale, transparent eyes and a large mouth that looked like the mouth of an idol of an animal that had been sacred. There was no name under the figure, but the name was not necessary, for every passerby on every street of the world knew the name and the wild blond hair and the fragile body. It was Kay Gonda.</p><p>The figure was half naked under its scant garment, but no one no�ticed that. No one looked at it conventionally and no one snickered. She stood, her head thrown back, her arms limp at her sides, palms up, helpless and frail, surrendering herself and imploring something far away, high over the blank marquee and over the roofs, as a flame held straight for an insight in an unknown wind, as a last plea rising from every roof, and every shop window, and every weary heart far under her feet. And passing the theater, no one did, but everyone wanted dimly to take off his hat.</p><p>Morrison Pickens had seen one of her pictures last evening. He had sat for an hour and a half without moving, and if breathing had re�quired attention, he would have forgotten to breathe. From the screen, a huge white face had looked at him, a face with a mouth one wished one could wish to kiss, and eyes that made one wonder&#x2014; wonder which was pain&#x2014;just what it was they were seeing. He felt as if there was something&#x2014;deep in his brain, behind everything he thought and everything he was&#x2014;which he did not know, but she knew, and he wished he did, and wondered whether he could ever know it, and should he, if he could, and why he wished it. He thought that she was just a woman and an actress, but he thought this only before he entered the theater and after he left it; while he looked at her on the screen, he thought differently; he thought that she was not a human being at all, not the kind of human being he&#x2019;d seen around him all his life, but the kind no one ever knew&#x2014;and should. When he looked at her, it made him feel guilty, but it also made him feel young&#x2014;and clean&#x2014;and very proud. When he looked at her, he understood why ancient peoples had made statues of gods in the image of man.</p><p>No one knew for certain who Kay Gonda was. There were people who said they remembered her when she was sixteen and working in a corset shop in Vienna. She wore a dress too short for her long, thin legs, with sleeves too short for her pale, thin arms. She moved behind the counter with a nervous swiftness that made people think that she be�longed in a zoo, rather than in a little shop with starched white curtains and a smell of stale lard. No one called her beautiful. Men never ap�proached her and landladies were eager to throw her out when she was behind in her rent. She spent long days fitting girdles to customers, her thin white fingers lacing strings tightly over heavy folds of flesh. The customers complained that her eyes made them uncomfortable.</p><p>There were also those who remembered her two years later when she worked as a maid in a disreputable hotel on a dark side street of Vienna. They remembered her walking down the stairs, holes glaring in the heels of her black cotton stockings, an old blouse gaping open at her throat. Men tried to speak to her, but she did not listen. Then, one night, she listened. He was a tall man with a hard mouth and eyes too observant ever to allow her to be happy; he was a famous film director who had not come to the hotel to see the maid. The woman who owned the place shrugged with indignation when she heard the maid laughing loudly, brutally, at the words the man whispered to her. But the great director denied vehemently the story of where he had discovered Kay Gonda, his greatest star.</p><p>In Hollywood she wore plain, dark dresses designed by a French�man whose salary could have financed an insurance concern. Her man�sion was entered through a long gallery of white marble columns, and her butler served cocktails in tall, narrow glasses. She walked as if the carpets and the stairs and the sidewalks rolled softly, soundlessly, from under the suspicion of her foot&#x2019;s touch. Her hair never looked combed. She shrugged her shoulders with a gesture that was a convulsion, and little bluish shadows played between her shoulder blades when she wore long, backless evening gowns. Everyone envied her. No one said she was happy.</p><p>Morrison Pickens swung his long legs over the side of his open roadster and shuffled up the polished steps to the reception desk of the Farrow Film Studios. He said to the young man behind the desk, who had a face pink and stern as frozen strawberry custard:</p><p>&#x201c;Pickens. Of the <i>Courier</i>. Want to see Mr. Farrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you have an appointment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. That won&#x2019;t make any difference&#x2014;<i>today</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Go right in, sir,&#x201d; said the young man eagerly, dropping the receiver on the answer of Mr. Farrow&#x2019;s secretary.</p><p>Mr. Farrow had three secretaries. The first one sat at a desk at a bronze railing, and she smiled icily, swinging the bronze gate open into an archway with a desk with three telephones and a secretary who rose to open a mahogany door into an office where a secretary rose to say:</p><p>&#x201c;Go right in, Mr. Pickens.&#x201d;</p><p>Anthony Farrow sat at a desk lost in a vast, white ballroom. It had leaded windows the height of three floors. It had a white statue of a Madonna in a niche. It had a huge crystal globe of the world on a white marble pedestal. It had a white satin chaise longue which looked as if no one had ever approached it; no one had. It was Mr. Farrow&#x2019;s prize possession&#x2014;and it was reported to have adorned, in days gone by, the boudoir of Empress Josephine.</p><p>Mr. Farrow had brownish-golden hair far at the back of his head and brownish-golden eyes. His suit matched the darkest thread of his hair, and his shirt&#x2014;the lightest. He said: &#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Pickens. Please sit down. I am delighted to see you,&#x201d; and extended an open box of cigars with a gesture worthy of the best close- p in a film of high society.</p><p>Mr. Pickens sat down and took a cigar.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Mr. Farrow, &#x201c;you realize that it is nothing but a lot of preposterous nonsense.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d; asked Morrison Pickens.</p><p>&#x201c;The gossip to which I owe the honor of your visit. The gossip about Miss Gonda.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; said Morrison Pickens.</p><p>&#x201c;My dear fellow, you must know how utterly ridiculous it is. I had hoped that your paper, a reputable paper like yours, would help us to prevent the spread of these totally unfounded rumors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s easy, Mr. Farrow. It&#x2019;s up to you. The rumors being totally unfounded, you know, of course, where Miss Gonda happens to be, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Consider for a moment that wild story, Mr. Pickens. Granton Sayers&#x2014;well, you know Granton Sayers. A fool, if I may be permitted to say so, a fool with the reputation of a genius&#x2014;which is always the case with fools, isn&#x2019;t it? Fifty million dollars three years ago. Today&#x2014;who knows? Perhaps fifty thousand. Perhaps fifty cents. But cut crystal swimming pools and a Greek temple in his garden. Ah, yes, and Kay Gonda. An expensive little plaything or art work&#x2014;according to how you want to look at it. Kay Gonda, that is, two years ago. Not today. Oh, no, not today. I know for certain that she had not seen Sayers for over a year previous to that dinner in Santa Barbara we&#x2019;ve all heard about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So the romance was all over? Cold as ice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Colder, Mr. Pickens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure of that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Positive, Mr. Pickens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But perhaps there had been a quarrel between them, some quarrel which . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None, Mr. Pickens. Never. He had proposed to her three times to my knowledge. She could have had him, Greek temple and oil wells and all, any day she wished. Why would she want to kill him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would she want to disappear?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Pickens, may I reverse the procedure of an interview with the press&#x2014;and ask you a question?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly, Mr. Farrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who in . . . who on earth started those rumors?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That,&#x201d; said Morrison Pickens, &#x201c;is what I thought you could tell me, Mr. Farrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s preposterous, Mr. Pickens, worse than preposterous. It&#x2019;s vi�cious. Hints, whispers, questions. All over town. If I could see any point in it, I&#x2019;d say someone was spreading it intentionally.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who would have a reason to do that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just it, Mr. Pickens. No one. Miss Gonda hasn&#x2019;t got an enemy in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Has she a friend?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, of course, why&#x2014;no,&#x201d; said Mr. Farrow suddenly, his voice earnest and puzzled by its own statement, &#x201c;no, she hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The way he looked at Morrison Pickens was real, simple helplessness. &#x201c;Why did you ask that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do you answer it like that?&#x201d; asked Morrison Pickens.</p><p>&#x201c;I . . . I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Mr. Farrow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never thought of it be�fore, it just struck me suddenly that she hasn&#x2019;t really got a single friend in the world. Unless it&#x2019;s Mick Watts, who nobody could call a friend to anybody. Oh, well,&#x201d; he added, shrugging, &#x201c;perhaps it&#x2019;s only natural. How can you think of friendship with a woman like that? She looks at you, but doesn&#x2019;t really see you at all. She sees something else, no one can guess what. She speaks to you&#x2014;when she speaks, which isn&#x2019;t often&#x2014; and you don&#x2019;t really know what she&#x2019;s thinking. Sometimes I&#x2019;m sure that she doesn&#x2019;t think what we think at all, you and I. Things don&#x2019;t mean the same to her as to the rest of us. But what they mean and what she means&#x2014; ho can tell? And, actually, who cares?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About seventy million people or so, judging by your box office re�ports.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes. Which, perhaps, is all that matters. They worship her, millions of them. It&#x2019;s not admiration. It&#x2019;s not just fan enthusiasm. It&#x2019;s much more than that. It&#x2019;s worship. I don&#x2019;t know what she does to them all&#x2014;but she does something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how will her public react to&#x2014;murder?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s incredible, Mr. Pickens, it&#x2019;s fantastic. How can anyone believe it for a moment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one would believe it for a moment if Miss Gonda hadn&#x2019;t disap�peared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, Mr. Pickens, she hasn&#x2019;t disappeared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She always wants to be alone when she&#x2019;s getting ready for a new picture. She&#x2019;s at one of her beach homes, studying her new part.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really, Mr. Pickens, we can&#x2019;t have her disturbed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Supposing we were to try and find her.

How does terror, abuse, or disaster affect a child's mind--and how can that mind recover? Child psychiatrist Bruce Perry has helped children faced with unimaginable horror: genocide survivors, murder witnesses, kidnapped teenagers, and victims of family violence. In <i>The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog</i>, he tells their stories of trauma and transformation through the lens of science, revealing the brain's astonishing capacity for healing. Deftly combining unforgettable case histories with his own compassionate, insightful strategies for rehabilitation, Perry explains what exactly happens to the brain when a child is exposed to extreme stress-and reveals the unexpected measures that can be taken to ease a child's pain and help him grow into a healthy adult. Through the stories of children who recover-physically, mentally, and emotionally-from the most devastating circumstances, Perry shows how simple things like surroundings, affection, language, and touch can deeply impact the developing brain, for better or for worse. In this deeply informed and moving book, Bruce Perry dramatically demonstrates that only when we understand the science of the mind can we hope to heal the spirit of even the most wounded child.</p><p><b>Bruce D. Perry</b>, M.D., Ph.D. is the Senior Fellow of The ChildTrauma Academy, a Houston-based non-profit organization which promotes innovations in service, research and education in child maltreatment and childhood trauma. He has served as a consultant to the FBI and is the former Chief of Psychiatry at Texas Children's Hospital, as well as former Vice-Chairman for Research in the Department of Psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine. He lives in Houston, Texas and Alberta, Canada. <b>Maia Szalavitz</b> is an award-winning journalist who specializes in science and health. She is the author of <i>Help at Any Cost: How the Troubled-Teen Industry Cons Parents and Hurts Kids</i> and <i>Recovery Options: The Complete Guide</i> with Joseph Volpicelli, M.D., Ph.D. She lives in New York City.In beautifully written, fascinating accounts of experiences working with emotionally stunted and traumatized children, child psychiatrist Perry educates readers about how early-life stress and violence affects the developing brain. He offers simple yet vivid illustrations of the stress response and the brain's mechanisms with facts and images that crystallize in the mind without being too detailed or confusing. The stories exhibit compassion, understanding and hope as Perry paints detailed, humane pictures of patients who have experienced violence, sexual abuse or neglect, and Perry invites the reader on his own journey to understanding how the developing child's brain works. He learns that to facilitate recovery, the loss of control and powerlessness felt by a child during a traumatic experience must be counteracted. Recovery requires that the patient be "in charge of key aspects of the therapeutic interaction." He emphasizes that the brain of a traumatized child can be remolded with patterned, repetitive experiences in a safe environment. Most importantly, as such trauma involves the shattering of human connections, "lasting, caring connections to others" are irreplaceable in healing; medications and therapy alone cannot do the job. "Relationships are the agents of change and the most powerful therapy is human love," Perry concludes. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Best-known today as the author of <i>Mephisto</i>, the literary <i>enfant terrible</i> of the Weimar era produced seven novels, a dozen plays, four biographies, and three autobiographies&#x2014;among them the first works in Germany to tackle gay issues&#x2014;amidst a prodigious artistic output. He was among the first to take up his pen against the Nazis, as a reward for which he was blacklisted and denounced as a dangerous half-Jew, his books burnt in public squares around Germany, and his citizenship revoked. Having served with the U.S. military in Italy, he was nevertheless undone by anti-Communist fanatics in Cold War-era America and Germany, dying in France (though not, as all other books contend, by his own hand) at age forty-two.&nbsp;<br><br> Powerful, revealing, and compulsively readable, this first English-language biography of Klaus Mann charts the effects of reactionary politics on art and literature and tells the moving story of a supreme talent destroyed by personal circumstance and the seismic events of the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Frederic Spotts </b>is an independent scholar who has written widely on cultural topics and on German and Italian politics. He is the author of <i>Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics</i>, among other books, and is the editor of the letters of Leonard Woolf.

He enables the reader to grasp the deep anxieties experienced by someone whose political convictions threatened his professional livelihood. . . . &nbsp;Above all he tells the heart-breaking story of an intellectual who stood up for his beliefs in dark times and paid a highly personal price for his politics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anna Katharina Schaffner, <i>TLS</i> (Anna Katherina Schaffner <i>TLS</i> 2016-08-19)<br><br>Finalist for the Lambda Literary Awards in the Gay Memoir/Biography category.

In this boldly original work, Jonathan Ned Katz challenges the common notion that the distinction between heterosexuality and homosexuality has been a timeless one. Building on the history of medical terminology, he reveals that as late as 1923, the term &#x201c;heterosexuality&#x201d; referred to a "morbid sexual passion," and that its current usage emerged to legitimate men and women having sex for pleasure. Drawing on the works of Sigmund Freud, James Baldwin, Betty Friedan, and Michel Foucault, <i>The Invention of Heterosexuality</i> considers the effects of heterosexuality&#x2019;s recently forged primacy on both scientific literature and popular culture.</p> <p> &#x201c;Lively and provocative.&#x201d;&#x2014;Carol Tavris, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p> <p> &#x201c;A valuable primer . . . misses no significant twists in sexual politics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gary Indiana, <i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i></p> <p> &#x201c;One of the most important&#x2014;if not outright subversive&#x2014;works to emerge from gay and lesbian studies in years.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark Thompson, <i>The Advocate</i></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<b>Jonathan Ned Katz </b>is the author of many books, including <i>Gay American History</i> and <i>Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality</i>, the latter published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>Katz's thoughtful, scholarly book examines the words <i>heterosexual</i> and <i>homosexual</i> both of which are scarcely 100 years old--and presents heterosexuality as a historical social convention rather than as a natural, eternal given. In arguing that these categorical terms are historical and thus changeable, Katz reminds us that until very recently, sex was considered mostly functional, urgently needed for procreation in order to populate fledgling American settlements. He then scrutinizes Freud's influence as a sex theorist who changed the image of woman from her nineteenth-century idealization as the "angel in the house" to one in which lack of erotic response constituted mental illness. Moving beyond Freud, he takes us through the twentieth century, stressing the conservatism of the 1940s and 1950s before coming eventually to the churning 1990s, when a theatrical review titled <i>Heterosexuals in Crisis</i> summarizes the "general sense of a different-sex erotic emergency." Along the way, he cites such sex theorists as Kate Millett, Ti-Grace Atkinson, and Michel Foucault, weaving them into his controversial, readable discourse. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Classic Horror Tales (Word Cloud Classics)</h2><p>Curl up with this collection of classic scary stories from the masters of the genre.<br><br>With dozens of stories of the macabre, fantastic, and supernatural, <i>Classic Horror Tales </i>is sure to keep readers on the edges of their seats.

"This brown girl dancing is me," Reeny announces, as her crayoned figures flit across the classroom walls. Soon enough we are drawn into Reeny's remarkable dance of self-revelation and celebration, and into the literary turn it takes when Reeny discovers a kindred spirit in Leo Lionni&#x2015;a writer of books and a teller of tales. Led by Reeny, Paley takes us on a tour through the landscape of characters created by Lionni. These characters come to dominate a whole year of discussion and debate, as the children argue the virtues and weaknesses of Lionni's creations and his themes of self-definition and an individual's place in the community.</p><p><i>The Girl with the Brown Crayon</i> tells a simple personal story of a teacher and a child, interweaving the themes of race, identity, gender, and the essential human needs to create and to belong. With characteristic charm and wonder, Paley discovers how the unexplored territory unfolding before her and Reeny comes to mark the very essence of school, a common core of reference, something to ponder deeply and expand on extravagantly.</p></p><p>Vivian Gussin Paley (1929&#x2013;2019), a longtime classroom teacher at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, was a MacArthur Fellow and winner of the 1998 American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement.&#x201c;Paley&#x2019;s book is the breathtaking account of a golden time she has carved out in the lives of [her school] children and herself. Essentially, she conducts a high-power kindergarten think tank in which she, the children, and some parents explore &#x2018;the artist&#x2019;s role in society, the conditions necessary for thinking, and the influence of music and art on the emotions.&#x2019; Infected by their teacher&#x2019;s enthusiasm, wisdom, and human warmth, these beautiful children shape their semester of art, dance, song, and applied psychology around 14 picture books by the great writer-illustrator Leo Lionni... [Paley] render[s] tellingly the originality and sensitivity with which her kindergartners explore art and life as they skip from work to work, character to character, and back to their daily lives with persistence, eloquence, and depth... Her book is a reminder for adult readers that our task, at home and abroad, is to ensure that children may flourish with such awareness of their own worth that they can be free, then, to love another.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter F. Neumeyer</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Paley [tells how she] and her co-teacher turn a sizable portion of their curriculum over to a study of Lionni stories, and her students blossom with insight... Paley&#x2019;s book is a treasure for anyone who wants to know more about what magic is possible in a classroom where a teacher encourages what Paley calls...a &#x2018;narrative community.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Carol Doup Muller</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Jose Mercury-News</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;To focus a year&#x2019;s curriculum on a single writer, no matter how acclaimed or popular, was a departure for [Vivian Gussin Paley] and her school. But as anyone can tell from reading <i>The Girl with the Brown Crayon</i>, Paley&#x2019;s experiment was a resounding success, cultivating among very young children a deep engagement with literature that they were able to share every day.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Molly McQuade</b><b>, </b><b><i>Book Links</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;I was delighted after an initial reading of <i>The Girl with the Brown Crayon</i> and couldn&#x2019;t wait to share it. However, after rereading the text and discussing it as a member of a learning community, I can more fully appreciate why it was awarded Harvard University Press&#x2019;s annual prize for an outstanding publication about education and society.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Reading Teacher</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Paley describes how] she decides to give direction to her curriculum by focusing on the books of one author, Leo Lionni... The result, as recorded in the book, is a long exploration, questioning, and debate among the children and teachers about the characteristics and actions of the characters and important ideas (which become curriculum themes) as the books are read, dramatized, and portrayed in notebooks and posters. Throughout this journey, Paley shares her unique insight into the nature of young children and kindergarten learning as it could be, as it should be.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Young Children</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A beautifully realized, deceptively simple classroom memoir from a longtime kindergarten teacher and author. Paley begins the narrative of her final year of teaching by focusing on Reeny, a self-assured, thoughtful, and creative black five-year-old girl in a class that&#x2019;s mostly Caucasian and Asian. Reeny is a wonderful character, but it is her identification with another character, Frederick the Mouse in a Leo Lionni children&#x2019;s book, that is the catalyst for a truly remarkable classroom experience... Disproving the general opinion that kindergartners are unable to focus on a lengthy, ongoing project, these children show an amazing aptitude for referring back to previous discussions, understanding metaphor, relating their reading to the world around them, and using the information they glean in creative and unusual ways. Their discussions cover everything from race and friendship to gender and the artistic personality, and they are able to appreciate the Lionni titles with a maturity that is sometimes startling... The reader closes the book with the hope that Paley will, with Reeny&#x2019;s help and her own newfound self-awareness, overcome her ambivalence about standing out and continue to write superb books like this one.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Paley, the charismatic teacher and author...is taken on a metaphorical journey of discovery and self-discovery by kindergartners with inquiring minds... [Paley&#x2019;s class] is an oasis, blessed with a unique curriculum and a teacher willing to be taught by her students.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><h2>The Norton Field Guide to Writing with Readings and Handbook</h2><p><p><strong>The most flexible writing guide&#x2015;now with advice for reading and writing across disciplines</strong></p> The <em>Norton Field Guide to Writing</em> features short chapters addressing every writing topic a high school student needs.

It provides authoritative and comprehensive information on general networking concepts, routing algorithms and protocols, addressing, and the mechanics of bridges, routers, switches, and hubs. This Second Edition is expanded and updated to cover the newest developments in the field, including advances in switching and bridge technology, VLANs, Fast Ethernet, DHCP, ATM, and IPv6. Additional new topics include IPX, AppleTalk, and DECnet. You will gain a deeper understanding of the range of solutions possible and find valuable information on protocols for which documentation is not readily available elsewhere. Written by the inventor of many of the algorithms that make switching and routing robust and efficient, Interconnections, Second Edition offers an experts insight into how and why networks operate as they do. Perlman describes all of the major networking algorithms and protocols in use today in clear and concise terms, while exploring the engineering trade-offs that the different approaches represent. The book contains extensive coverage of such topics as: *The spanning tree algori</p><p>This latest release of <i>Interconnections</i> is a competent update of a networking classic. Radia Perlman explains hundreds of details about getting computers--and computer networks--to talk to one another smoothly, accurately, and efficiently. Perlman, inventor of the spanning-tree bridging algorithm, covers the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model, bridges, switches, hubs, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), plus connection-based and connectionless networks. She also does a great job of explaining the underpinnings of internetworking protocols, including packet format, addressing, routing (both generically and in terms of RIP, RTMP, OSPF, and other protocols), and security. There's plenty of IPv6 information here, mostly from a theoretical vantage point.<p> The best parts of Perlman's approach to her subject are the little thought experiments that explain why various aspects of internetworking behave the way they do. For example, Perlman talks about Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) discovery by presenting four different hypotheses for figuring out MTU. For each possible solution, she discusses strengths, weaknesses, and real-life considerations. She applies this method to dozens of other problems and phenomena, making <i>Interconnections</i> a very close approximation of learning by experiment. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) reference model, bridges, switches, hubs, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), and internetworking protocols.</p><p></p><p> Interconnections, Second Edition is about what goes on inside the boxes that move data around the Internet. These boxes are variously called bridges, routers, switches, and hubs. The book also describes the devices that connect to the network. </p><p> There is considerable confusion in this area. Most of the terminology is ill defined and is used in conflicting ways. The terminology and the specifications tend to be daunting. Some knowledge is spread among many different documents; much is unwritten folk wisdom. Adding to the confusion is dogma. Beliefs are accepted as truth, and questioning any of the dogma is often greeted with hostility. But good engineering demands that we understand what we're doing and why, keep an open mind, and learn from experience. </p><p> In Interconnections, Second Edition, instead of diving right into the details of one protocol, I first focus on the problems to be solved. I examine various solutions to each of these problems and discuss the engineering trade-offs involved. Then I look at a variety of solutions that have been deployed and compare the approaches. I give technical arguments for any opinions, and if you think I have missed any arguments I welcome email discussion. My email address is at the back of the book, which I hope you will find after having read the book cover to cover. </p><p> In the first edition, my intention was to help people understand the problems and the general types of solutions, assuming that they would read the specifications to get the details of specific protocols. But people used the book as a reference in addition to using it to understand the issues. So in this edition I have documented many more of the protocols in detail. </p><p> I believe that to understand something deeply you need to compare it to something else. The first edition was "minimalist" in that I always used only two examples: two types of bridges, bridges versus routers, connection-oriented versus connectionless network layer protocols, and two examples of connectionless protocols (CLNP and IP). In this edition I add a lot more examples, including ATM, IPv6, IPX, AppleTalk, and DECnet. I did this in part because these protocols exist, and it is hard to get information about them. But mostly I did it because the protocols embody interesting ideas that should not be lost. When we design new protocols, we should learn from previous ideas, both good and bad. Also, it takes very little additional effort, after the problem is described generically, to describe several examples. Roadmap to the Book</p><p></p><p> The first four chapters are not significantly different from their counterparts in the first edition, but the rest of the book has been largely rewritten. Chapters 1 through 4 cover general networking concepts, data link issues such as addressing and multiplexing, transparent bridges and the spanning tree algorithm, and source routing bridges. Chapter 5 is completely new and explains how the notion of a switch evolved into a rediscovery of the bridge. It also covers VLANs and fast Ethernet. </p><p> The remainder of the book concentrates on layer 3 (the network layer). Chapter 6 gives an overview of the network layer. Chapter 7 covers connection-oriented networks, including ATM and X.25. Chapter 8 discusses the issues in a generic connectionless network layer. Chapter 9 covers layer 3 addressing generically and gives a detailed comparison of IP, IPv6, CLNP, DECnet, AppleTalk, and IPX. Chapter 10 covers the information that should appear in a network layer header and contrasts the headers of several protocols. </p><p> Chapter 11 covers autoconfiguration and neighbor discovery, including protocols such as ARP and DHCP. Chapter 12 covers routing algorithms generically. </p><p> Chapter 13 discusses the problem of doing longest-prefix matching, which is required in order to forward IP packets quickly. Chapter 14 discusses the specifics of various routing protocols including RIP, IS-IS, OSPF, PNNI, NLSP, and BGP. Chapter 15 covers network layer multicast. Chapter 16 explains how to design a network that is invulnerable to sabotage, an idea whose time may come.</p><p></p><p> The final two chapters summarize the book, and I hope they will be mostly light and entertaining reading. Chapter 17 probes the mystery of what, if anything, distinguishes a router from a bridge. Chapter 18 attempts to capture folk wisdom about how to design a protocol. </p><p> Finally, there is an extensive glossary. I try to define terms when I first use them, but if I ever fail to do that, you will probably find them in the glossary. Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p> Writing this section is scary because I am afraid I will leave people out. I'd like to thank the people who reviewed all or part of the book: Peter Memishian, Paul Koning, Tony Lauck, Craig Partridge, Dan Pitt, Brian Kernighan, Paul Bottorff, Joel Halpern, Charlie Kaufman, Mike Speciner, Andy Tanenbaum, Phil Rosenzweig, Dan Senie, William Welch, Craig Labovitz, Chase Bailey, George Varghese, and Suchi Raman. Other people who have been helpful by answering questions are Ariel Hendel, Rich Kubota, Stuart Cheshire, Tom Maufer, Steve Deering, and John Moy. The first time I sent an email question in the middle of the night (when I did most of my work on this book) to Craig Partridge, the co-series editor for this book, the beep indicating incoming mail happened so immediately that I assumed it was an automatic mail responder informing me he was on vacation. But it was an answer to my question. I assume he doesn't have an automatic mail responder so clever that it can answer technical questions, so I thank him for being so prompt and available. Brian Kernighan, the other series editor, also had detailed and helpful comments on the entire book. </p><p> The people at Addison-Wesley have been amazingly patient with me for the many years in which I've been working on this edition. I'm not sure they had any alternative besides patience, but it was nice that they believed I'd finish even when I wasn't so sure. So thank you to Mary Hart, Karen Gettman, Jacquelyn Doucette, and Jason Jones. And I'd also like to thank my copy editor, Betsy Hardinger. She of all people will have read every word of the book, while maintaining the concentration to note inconsistencies and ways of removing excess words here and there. I know it's her job, but I'm still impressed. </p><p> Mike Speciner helped me figure out the mysteries of Framemaker. Ray Perlner made sure that I maintained some humor in the book and watched over my shoulder while I typed the last chapter to see that I had enough funny bad real-life protocols. Dawn Perlner has been terrifically supportive, convincing her friends and even strangers in bookstores to buy my books. She used to be my child. Now she's a wonderful friend.</p><p>0201634481P04062001</p></p><h2>Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History, and Meaning</h2><p>This widely acclaimed, beautifully illustrated survey of Western architecture is now fully revised throughout, including essays on non-Western traditions.

But how many investors have the time, talent, and luck to earn consistent returns this way? In <i>The Ultimate Dividend Playbook:</i> <i>Income, Insight, and Independence for Today's Investor,</i> Peters shows you why you don't have to try to beat the market and how you can use dividends to do the heavy lifting. </p><p>What exactly are dividends? Basically, a dividend is a transfer of assets, almost always cash, from a corporation to its shareholders. Not all corporations, even those with enormous profits and sizable cash reserves, are willing to pay them out to shareholders, but many corporations do. Some pay out only a little, while others&#x2014;the kind of companies this book tells you about&#x2014;pay out a lot, thereby setting the investor free from fickle market prices and unreliable capital gains. </p><p>This practical resource focuses on three essential elements: income, information, and independence. Most investors are familiar with income, but what you may not know is that dividends convey crucial information like a company's financial health and growth prospects, and that an investment strategy using dividends and dividends alone offers rewards not subject to the whims of Wall Street. </p><p>So let others chase capital gains, add up their statement values, and try to time the market. Dividends are the ultimate source of a stock's value for shareholders. <i>The Ultimate Dividend Playbook</i> will help you frame an approach&#x2014;emotional as much as intellectual or financial&#x2014;and assemble a portfolio of well-chosen, dividend-rich stocks that can deliver the income and growth you seek.</p><p><b>JOSH PETERS, CFA,</b> is an equities strategist and editor of the monthly newsletter <i>Morningstar� DividendInvestor&#x2122;</i>.

In all respects it appears to be an ordinary country estate, but for the two-storey row of offices jutting from its left wing. This oddly shaped building is surrounded by a tall wrought-iron fence, at the entrance of which stands a uniformed guard. On the morning following our episode at the Diogenes, the guard on duty was named Ian Turks. Upon our arrival at Gairstowe, I found myself making this young man's acquaintance while Holmes immediately threw himself down on all fours and began crawling about the grounds of the estate.I have no doubt that Turks had never before seen a well turned-out, middle-aged gentleman behave in such a manner. Holmes sniffed about like a bloodhound, examining patches of grass with his convex lens and occasionally lying prostate for several moments, evidently absorbed in the deepest concentration. Though Turks, like the Palace Guards, was obviously trained to remain impassive in unusual situations, at length the young man was unable to contain his curiosity.&#x201c;Pardon me asking, mate,&#x201d; said he, &#x201c;but what is that fellow doing on the ground there?&#x201d;&#x201c;Looking for footprints, no doubt,&#x201d; I answered.&#x201c;Footprints! But all the footprints are inside! The bobbies found 'em.&#x201d;&#x201c;He is aware of that, but he tends to carry his examinations a step or two beyond those of the official detectives.&#x201d;&#x201c;Who is he then?&#x201d;&#x201c;Mr. Sherlock Holmes.&#x201d;Turks gave a low whistle and stared again at my companion who had now rolled over on his back to survey the soles of his own shoes. &#x201c;That's who he is? Cor! He's better looking in the drawings, isn't he!&#x201d;*Before I could formulate a reply, Holmes leapt to his feet and shouted across the grass to me. &#x201c;Come along, Watson! There is nothing more to be learned here!&#x201d;Together we climbed the marble steps which led into the large entrance hall. There our cards were taken by a butler - rather too formally dressed for the early hour - who returned in a moment to conduct us into the presence of Lord O'Neill, the Secretary for European Affairs.We were shown through a narrow corridor hung with oriental tapestries and into a large study lined with oak bookcases. Behind a scrivener's desk sat the man whom I took to be Lord O'Neill, and across from him sat a very large gentleman of stiff bearing, whom I did not recognise.&#x201c;Sherlock Holmes!&#x201d; cried Lord O'Neill, rising so hastily that he swept a small stack of papers onto the floor. &#x201c;I was delighted to receive your wire this morning! I wanted to send for you myself, but your brother, Mycroft, he, well-&#x201d; He trailed off nervously. &#x201c;And you must be Dr. Watson! You are welcome here, sir. Ah! Forgive me! I have been remiss! Allow me to present the honourable Herr Nichlaus Osey of Germany.&#x201d;The German rose and bowed formally in our direction. &#x201c;I am pleased to meet the famous crime specialist,&#x201d; he said in well-praised English, &#x201c;though I did not expect that you would look quite this way&#x201d;, he added, looking askance at Holmes's dishevelled, grass-stained clothing.&#x201c;Mr. Holmes's methods are a bit unorthodox,&#x201d; Lord O'Neill said quickly, &#x201c;but his results speak for themselves I assure you, I assure you. I was telling Herr Osey of your invaluable assistance during that ugly business back in 1900.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ah, yes,&#x201d; said Holmes carelessly, &#x201c;a simple case, but not without some features of interest. I have recorded it in my notes as 'The Adventure of the Discursive Italian'.&#x201d;&#x201c;Holmes,&#x201d; I asked, though I saw that Lord O'Neill was anxious to proceed, &#x201c;do you mean to say that you keep your own records of your cases?&#x201d;&#x201c;Don't look hurt, old fellow! At the time you had deserted me for Mrs. Watson. I could not allow your lapse to disrupt the flow of crime history.&#x201d;&#x201c;Fascinating,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c; May I-?&#x201d;&#x201c;Gentlemen, please!&#x201d; Lord O'Neill cried. &#x201c;The affair before us is a most pressing one! We must attend to it. Shall I ring for tea? Yes, we must have tea.&#x201d; He darted to the bell-rope and pulled it urgently.&#x201c;Tea!&#x201d; exclaimed Herr Osey. &#x201c;At such a time! And all of this talk about records and discursive Italians. It is a wonder you British ever accomplish anything!&#x201d;Herr Osey, please,&#x201d; said Lord O'Neill anxiously. &#x201c;I'm sure-&#x201d;&#x201c;Who is this remarkable woman with whom the prince has been so indiscreet?&#x201d;Many times in my years with Holmes have I seen him produce a startling revelation from the mist of seemingly unexceptional circumstances, but never has one of the abrupt observations had such tremendous impact. It was as if the two diplomats had been struck by lightning.&#x201c;Mr. Holmes!&#x201d; cried Lord O'Neill, leaping to his feet.&#x201c;<i>Mein Gott!</i>&#x201d; shouted Herr Osey. &#x201c;Can this be? How could you-&#x201d;&#x201c;Your tea, sir,&#x201d; announced the butler, rolling in a large tea-trolley.Herr Osey thrust his fists into his pockets and turned to the wall. Lord O'Neill fell heavily into a chair, the colour draining from his face, but he managed to collect himself sufficiently to acknowledge the arrival of the tea. The butler then withdrew, and both men turned to stare at Sherlock Holmes.&#x201c;Gentlemen! It is perfectly obvious! Allow me to explain. Lestrade has been good enough to leave the room in order, so it is difficult to see that a conference of some sort took place on the night of the crime. The brandy snifters on the sideboard point to a late evening, very likely while the larger gathering was taking place downstairs. The desk calendar has not been advanced since the day before yesterday. As Lord O'Neill is rather fastidious in such details, we may assume that the room has not been in use since then.&#x201d;&#x201c;Perfectly sound,&#x201d; admitted Lord O'Neill. &#x201c;But how-&#x201d;&#x201c;That the conference was an important one is rather strongly suggested by the presence of the Prince of Wales. Here is a cigar stub bearing the mark of his private stock. Even more revealing are the contents of this ashtray beside the armchair. In it there are two cigarette ends stained red. Unless one of you two gentlemen has taken to painting his lips, we may infer the presence of a woman.&#x201c;What sort of woman is is who smokes in such company? A rather strong-willed woman, certainly. Also, it would seem, a familiar of the Prince. Yet, rather than make use of the cigarette case we see here upon the desk, this woman's cigarettes were provided for her by Herr Osey, whose own stubs we see here in the same ashtray. This fact is not without implication.&#x201d;Herr Osey took the cigarette from his lips and stamped it out peevishly.&#x201c;The woman is a German, involved in some sort of diplomatic unpleasantness. This much is obvious by the involvement of you two gentlemen. So, what is the scene we have evolved? A large gathering at Gairstowe House after the theatre. While they are entertained downstairs, a smaller party assembles in this room to discuss business. This business must concern the documents which have since vanished. The prince and this mysterious woman-&#x201d; Holmes paused and looked to Herr Osey.&#x201c;The Countess Valenka,&#x201d; the German provided.Holmes nodded. &#x201c;-would not customarily be present at such an interview. Therefore they are the principals and you gentlemen are their representatives.&#x201d;&#x201c;What can be the unpleasantness which would induce two former intimates to employ diplomatic representation? Well, now. The Prince has certain... compromising tendencies which are well known. Perhaps he has placed himself in the awkward-&#x201d;&#x201c;Mr. Holmes, please!&#x201d; cried Lord O'Neill wildly. &#x201c;We have followed your reasoning quite closely. Pray do not continue!&#x201d; While Herr Osey had listened to Holmes' discourse with a fascinated detachment, Lord O'Neill had become increasingly anxious, and he was now unable to control himself. &#x201c;You have perceived the nature of our difficulty, and can now appreciate that it is sensitive beyond my ability to speculate.&#x201d;&#x201c;Letters then?&#x201d;&#x201c;Letters,&#x201d; confirmed Herr Osey.&#x201c;Confound it! There is no milk for this tea!&#x201d;&#x201c;No matter, my friend,&#x201d; said Herr Osey. &#x201c;We shall take it dark.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes, quite right,&#x201d; said Lord O'Neill with an embarrassed laugh. &#x201c;It's a silly thing, I know, but my nerves-&#x201c;&#x201c;Indeed. We are all on edge.&#x201d; Herr Osey took a cup of tea. &#x201c;It is as you say, Mr. Holmes. We had met to discuss a number of indiscreet letters of which the Countess was threatening to make use.&#x201d;&#x201c;And it is this letters we are now missing?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Lord O'Neill resumed. &#x201c;She had turned them over to us, after much discussion and a promise of rather substantial remuneration. But when I returned the following morning, the letters were missing.&#x201d;&#x201c;Did you examine the room thoroughly? Was it disturbed in any way?&#x201d;&#x201c;Nothing was disturbed or missing save the letters. And the only evidence of an intruder was these footprints behind the desk.&#x201d;&#x201c;The footprints! Of course, let us have a look at the footprints,&#x201d; said Holmes, crawling behind the desk. &#x201c;Humm. Most remarkable. Watson, would you step over here?&#x201d; he asked, brandishing his convex lens. &#x201c;Have a look, will you?&#x201d;Behind the desk was a muddy cluster of footprints which seemed to have been made by someone shuffling in place for a time. &#x201c;We are told that these are the footprints of Mr. Houdini,&#x201d; Lord O'Neill said.&#x201c;Quite Right!&#x201d; Holmes agreed. &#x201c;In fact, I've had occasion to examine his shoes recently and I recognise the tread. And yet, I must say that in all my years of practice I have never seen such unusual impressions.&#x201d;&#x201c;What is so extraordinary about them, Holmes?&#x201d; I asked.&#x201c;What? My good fellow, what about them is ordinary? Observe: In an ordinary footprint the greatest pressure is exerted by the heel and ball of the foot. In these impressions, the greatest weight has been placed on the direct centre of the foot, the arch. What does this suggest to you?&#x201d;&#x201c;Wooden legs?&#x201d;Holmes turned to me with a look of surprise. &#x201c;You never cease to amaze, Watson,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;Indeed, one wooden appendage is possible, but two? I think it more likely that these prints were made by a hand bearing down on the centre of a show.&#x201d;&#x201c;In order to implicate Houdini?&#x201d;&#x201c;Obviously. But what is truly suspicious is that there are no footprints leading to or away from this cluster, Could our muddy-footed thief simply have appeared directly in the centre of the room? And as to the mud itself, that is indeed peculiar. You are aware, Watson, that I have made a little study of the varieties of mud to be found about London. It is a useful knowledge for tracing one's movements by the spots upon his trouser cuff. Yet I cannot place the origin of this mud.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why, it is the mud from outside, surely,&#x201d; volunteered Herr Osey.&#x201c;Surely. But where outside? Not on the grounds of this estate. Of that I am certain. When we have located the source of this mud we shall have gone a long way towards our solution, I assure you.&#x201d; Holmes stood up and gazed vaguely about the room. &#x201c;It was just the four of you, then?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;&#x201c;No one else came in or out?&#x201d;&#x201c;Just the serving man.&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;&#x201c;We had tea then, as well.&#x201d;&#x201c;At that hour?&#x201d;&#x201c;The Prince enjoys it.&#x201d;&#x201c;Quite right. I had forgotten. And when your business was concluded, the letters were surrendered and placed in the desk?&#x201d;&#x201c;In the lower drawer.&#x201d;&#x201c;Pardon me,&#x201d; I ventured, &#x201c;but am I to understand that the letters were left in an unlocked drawer? We were told that they were placed in a vault.&#x201d;Lord O'Neill could not resist chuckling at my confusion. &#x201c;Dr. Watson, this room <i>is</i> a vault.&#x201d;&#x201c;I don't understand.&#x201d;&#x201c;Let me show you,&#x201d; said Lord O'Neill, leading me into the narrow corridor through which we had entered. &#x201c;See here,&#x201d; he said, pulling aside the oriental hangings to reveal, recessed into the wall itself, an enormous vault door and the rails upon which it ran.&#x201c;Exactly like a bank vault,&#x201d; I said admiringly.&#x201c;Actually, my friend, it is considerably more secure,&#x201d; said Lord O'Neill with pride. &#x201c;There are three separate locking mechanisms contained in this door. One British, one American, and the third European, making this one of the most secure vaults in the Empire. So you see, as there are no other entrances to the room, and no windows through which a man might pass, any object left in this room is as good as in the bank.&#x201d;&#x201c;Or so you thought,&#x201d; remarked Herr Osey.&#x201c;Yes, or so we thought.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, do not despair,&#x201d; said Holmes. &#x201c;We have but a few questions and then Dr. Watson and I shall make every effort to bring the matter to a happy conclusion. First, may we assume that no one can leave or enter the grounds of the estate without being observed by the guard?&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes. There is a guard round the clock, and they keep an admitting list.&#x201d;&#x201c;May we have a copy of the list for the evening of the reception?&#x201d;&#x201c;I'll have it drawn up immediately.&#x201d;&#x201c;Please be certain that it includes any help you were required to lay on for the affair-kitchen staff, footmen, and so on.&#x201d;&#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d;&#x201c;Fine. Now then, do you have a portrait of the Countess Valenka?&#x201d;&#x201c;No Mr. Holmes. I do not.&#x201d;Herr Osey cleared his throat. &#x201c;This may be of some use,&#x201d; he said uneasily. He drew out his pocket-watch and opened it towards us. There on the inner cover was an ivory miniature of one of the most striking profiles I have ever seen.&#x201c;The countess gave this to me some time ago,&#x201d; Herr Osey told us. &#x201c;I realise that a photograph would be of more use to you, but-&#x201d;&#x201c;Not at all, Herr Osey,&#x201d; said Holmes as he bent over the miniature. &#x201c;True, a photograph would have been more practical for purposes of identification, but this is informative nonetheless.&#x201d; He glanced upward as Herr Osey closed up his watch and replaced it in his waistcoat pocket. &#x201c;Yes, well. Humph. Where may we call upon the Countess?&#x201d;&#x201c;She is staying at the Cleland.&#x201d;&#x201c;Very good. We shall be on our way, then. Our first order of business is to exculpate Mr. Houdini, then we shall call upon the Countess Valenka. Good day, gentlemen.&#x201d;&#x201c;Mr. Holmes,&#x201d; said Lord O'Neill, &#x201c;we are considerably less interested in the innocence or guilt of Mr. Houdini than in the recovery of the stolen letters.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; agreed Herr Osey, &#x201c;let that be your first consideration.&#x201d;Sherlock Holmes picked up his hat and stick, and, striding blithely past the vault door, affected not to hear.</p><h2>Exploring Psychology with Updates on Dsm-5</h2><p>Normal wear and tear from moderate use.

Yet today we have only a limited knowledge of her considerable life&#39;s work as a poet, in part because of a lack of representative but accessible editions of her work. Readers will find here not only her well-known sonnet sequence of love poems, Sonnets From the Portuguese, but also lesser known sonnets, some in praise of the cross-dressing bohemian writer George Sand, others to contemporary poets and artists. Her religious and spiritual poetry echoes that of the Metaphysical poets. A different voice emerges in her social and political protest poems, such as &#39;The Cry of the Children&#39; and &#39;The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim&#39;s Point&#39;. Her experimental ballads allowed her to develop a distinctive way of writing about women within an apparently conventional form. In the outstanding work of her maturity, Aurora Leigh, the woman&#39;s voice takes centre stage. This &#39;novel-poem&#39; is full of verve and interest, with a female poet-hero who casts a caustic eye on life and on her fellow men - and women. We all think we know the story of Elizabeth Barrett Browning - the mysterious illness which enclosed her in her room, her over-loving but imperious father, and her romantic, secret marriage to the poet Robert Browning and their life together in Italy. But this comprehensive selection of her poetry tells the real story of her sustained creative life as a poet, which began with her childhood poetic ambitions and ended only with her death. All the major aspects of her poetry are represented in this accessible edition which is well-annotated and contextualised, with a wide-ranging introduction which covers Barrett Browning&#39;s poetic and intellectual life as well as her personal one. Recent critical re-readings, including major feminist reassessments, of her poetry are covered in the introduction, with helpful suggestions for further reading.</p><p></p><h2>A Society without Fathers or Husbands: The Na of China</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating account of the Na society, which functions without the institution of marriage.</b></p><p>The Na of China, farmers in the Himalayan region, live without the institution of marriage. Na brothers and sisters live together their entire lives, sharing household responsibilities and raising the women's children. Because the Na, like all cultures, prohibit incest, they practice a system of sometimes furtive, sometimes conspicuous nighttime encounters at the woman's home. The woman's partners&#x2015;she frequently has more than one&#x2015;bear no economic responsibility for her or her children, and "fathers," unless they resemble their children, remain unidentifiable. This lucid ethnographic study shows how a society can function without husbands or fathers. It sheds light on marriage and kinship, as well as on the position of women, the necessary conditions for the acquisition of identity, and the impact of a communist state on a society that it considers backward.</p></p><p>Cai Hua is Director of the Center for Anthropological and Folkloric Studies at the Peking University.Marriage is the foundation of all societies, anthropologists have claimed. Yet the Na, an ethnic minority living in China's Himalayan foothills, have enjoyed a successful culture without it. The Na are a truly matrilineal society: heterosexual activity occurs by mutual consent and mostly through the custom of the secret nocturnal "visit"; men and women are free to have multiple partners and to initiate or break off relationships when they please. Children are raised by their mother's family, with the biological father playing no role whatsoever. Cai Hua, director of research at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences in China, lived among the Na for extended periods during the 1980s and 1990s and gathered comprehensive data on their history, religion, economic practices and social customs in particular, kinship systems. The resulting description and analysis, originally presented as his master's thesis, introduces a fascinating culture for whom "sexuality is not a piece of merchandise but a purely sentimental and amorous matter that implies no mutual constraints." (Hua does not mention whether homosexual activity is similarly tolerated.) Na men and women generally report high satisfaction with their sex lives. As in other cultures, though, physically unattractive, disabled and older individuals have few (if any) romantic options; high rates of sexually transmitted diseases also occur. This painstakingly researched book will provide social scientists with much useful information and will raise major questions about accepted views of family relationships and gender roles. Its dry prose, clinical tone and exhaustive scope, however, may prove daunting for general readers. (May 1) Forecast: Touted as a groundbreaking study, this book is clearly intended for specialists. Though thoroughly researched and meticulously presented, it lacks the kind of readability that could have made it a 21st-century Coming of Age in Samoa.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Sierra Nevada Natural History (Volume 73) (California Natural History Guides)</h2><p>The magnificent and much-loved Sierra Nevada, called the "Range of Light" by John Muir, is the dominant feature on the California landscape.

Nothing came easily to Malamud: his family was poor, his mother probably committed suicide when Malamud was 14, and his younger brother inherited her schizophrenia. Davis's meticulous biography explores the many connections between Malamud's life and work, revealing all that it meant for this man to be a writer, both in terms of how he brought his life into his writing and how his writing affected his life. It also restores Bernard Malamud's literary reputation as one of the great original voices of his generation, a writer of superb subtlety and clarity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Davis</strong> is Professor of English Literature at Liverpool University. He has been reading Malamud for over thirty years.<br><br>"Wise, scrupulous, resolutely admiring.... Davis is out to remove the slur of moral uptightness and narrow virtue from Malamud's reputation. Gratifyingly, he wants to restore him to the pantheon of great American writers in which Malamud, in our flash-in-the-pan culture, once belonged."--Lee Siegel, <em>New York Times Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"A wonderfully readable, illuminating and entertaining biography. It is rare that a biographer succeeds in evoking, with a novelists skill, such compassion for his (flawed, human) subject; yet more rare, that a biographer succeeds in so drawing the reader into the shimmering world he has constructed out of a small infinity of letters, drafts, notes, manuscripts, printed texts, interview transcripts etc, that the barrier between reader and subject becomes near-transparent."--Joyce Carol Oates, <em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br>"Davis is frequently insightful."--Mark Oppenheimer, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Davis has succeeded in evoking a human being who is interesting in and of himself, quite apart from his literary output. Davis has an understanding of Malamud, the world in which he grew up and that in which he lived his adult life, which is all but flawless in its perceptions and insights."--Martin Rubin, <em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"Davis's book is laudable."--Ben Naparstek, <em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"[A] magnificent labour of love. A triumphant vindication of the art of biography."--Clive Sinclair, <em>Jewish Quarterly </em><p></p><br>"Excellent...I was impressed with Davis's treatment of the life and the work, and particularly intrigued by his take on Malamud's rapport with Philip Roth, one of the novelist's harshest critics and deepest admirers."--Rachel Donadio, <em>New York Times</em> "Paper Cuts"<p></p><br>"Davis' profound affinity for his subject shapes every discerning paragraph, as do his unprecedented conversations with Malamud's family and colleagues and access to private papers. Matching enthusiastic research with fluent empathy and keen aesthetic understanding, Davis grasps the resonance of Malamud's mother's mental illness and his father's lonely struggle in his humble grocery store while insightfully chronicling Malamud's marriage and teaching career. Wisely eschewing the quotidian, Davis illuminates Malamud's utter devotion to writing."--Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Davis offers an intimate portrait of Malamud's various 'lives' More important, Davis shows the enormous labor of revision that Malamud's art entailed." --Donald Weber, <em>Bookforum</em><p></p><br>"In all, this is a highly readable, informative, and enjoyable volume on an important literary figure." <em>--Jewish Book World</em><p></p><br>"A revealing portrait of a compelling writer." <em>--Jewish Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"Unlike many literary biographies in which a writer's work gets lost in the attention to the external events of the life, Davis's biography focuses on Malamud's life mainly as it illuminates the process by which the plots, the sentences and the paragraphs of the stories and novels come into existence It inspired me." --Eugene Goodheart, <em>Moment </em><p></p><br>"What Davis's biography helps us understand is how Malamud made use of his life's experiences: It deepens one's appreciation of his stories and novels by demonstrating how he transmuted his experience into art." --Joseph Epstein, <em>Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"This biography may help to refurbish Malamud's position as a major American Jewish writer." --Dr. Morton I. Teicher, <em>Jewish Advocate</em><p></p><br>"Philip Davis's biography of Bernard Malamud is everything a writer hopes to find in the biography of a great writer. Davis is a great reader, and he sees where Malamud's writings are coming from." --A. S. Byatt, <em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Philip Davis' most remarkable achievement is to have reconstructed Malamud's writing life out of the layers of manuscripts and drafts of his works. He makes you want to reread slowly the works you probably raced thorugh years ago I don't know of any biography of a literary person that pays this much attention to style and does it so well."--Dean Flower, <em>The Hudson Review</em><p></p><br>"A sensitive yet probing biography." --Ruth Franklin, <em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"Philip Davis' biography...succeeds in giving us a writer who, like his creations, managed to elicit extraordinary resonance by drawing the bow of language across the strings of an ordinary, small--and often somber--life."--<em>Haaretz</em><p></p><br>"A wonderful addition to Malamud studies; recommended for literature collections."--<em>Library Journal </em><p></p><br>"Fascinating."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Davis's book is laudable, if not always engrossing, for its refusal to glibly psychologize or strike false epiphanies to make Malamud's life read like fiction. It is fortunate that Davis's biography has arrived."--<em>Jerusalem Post</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Civil Procedure (Hornbooks)</h2><p>Gain insight into the laws governing all of the major steps in the civil litigation process, starting with investigation and ending with post-appeal collateral attacks. This text covers the major themes underlying the governing legal standards and those basic issues that the case law and literature suggest to be the most pressing.

Arguing that the text currently accepted is not, in fact, the most authoritative version of the play, this new edition turns to the First Folio of 1623--Shakespeare's "fair copy"--that has been preserved for us in the Second Quarto. Introducing fresh theatrical momentum, this revision provides, as Shakespeare intended, a better, more practical acting script.</p><p>This edition tells the story of Hamlet in production, from Burbage at the Globe to Branagh on film, relating stage interpretations to developments in the theatre, in literary criticism and in society. The detailed stage history records an ongoing process of discovery, as successive performers have found what it is in the play that will speak most powerfully to the audiences of their own times. The introduction focuses not only on star Hamlets, but on whole productions of the play including supporting players and, in this century, direction and design.This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.</p><h2>King Henry IV (The Arden Shakespeare)</h2><p>This edition of Shakespeare&#39;s Henry IV, Part 1 uses a variety of approaches to Shakespeare, including historical and cultural studies approaches. Shakespeare&#39;s text is accompanied by an intriguing collection of thematically arranged historical and cultural documents and illustrations designed to give a firsthand knowledge of the contexts out of which Henry IV, Part 1 emerged. Hodgdon&#39;s intelligent and engaging introductions to the play and to the documents (most of which are presented in modern spelling and with annotations) offer a richly textured understanding of Elizabethan culture and Shakespeare&#39;s work within that culture.</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s. The series, long since out-of-print, is now reissued. Each work contains a lengthy and lively introduction, main text, and substantial notes and glossary.A play alive with escapades and action, comedy and history, <i>Henry IV, Part One</i> begins the transformation of the madcap Prince Hal into the splendid ruler King Henry. In it a rebellion against King and State is juxtaposed with another rebellion--the riotous misbehavior of Hal and his companions, principally Falstaff. A superbly funny liar, coward, lecher, and cheat, the larger-than-life character Falstaff turns this great historical drama into a masterpiece of counterpoint and design.</p><h2>Sweet Temptation (Sweet Evil, 4)</h2><p><p>This swoonworthy, romantic companion novel to Wendy Higgins's <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Sweet Evil series is told from irresistible bad-boy Kaidan's point of view. Readers will love getting inside Kaidan's head, especially fans of the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, the Selection series by Kiera Cass, and <em>Walking Disaster</em> by Jamie McGuire.</p><p>When bad-boy drummer Kaidan Rowe encounters good girl Anna Whitt, the girl chosen to vanquish the demons from earth, he can't stop thinking about her.

In this critical response, Lacoste confronts the ultimate definition of human nature, the humanity of the human. He explores that definition through an analysis of the &#x201c;absolute&#x201d; as a phenomenological datum.</p><p>Lacoste establishes a conception of human nature that opens possibilities for religious experience and religious identity in view of Heidegger&#x2019;s profound challenge. He develops a phenomenology of the liturgy, and subjects the categories of &#x201c;experience,&#x201d; &#x201c;place,&#x201d; and &#x201c;human existence&#x201d; to careful examination. Making a strong case for the affective nature of religious experience, he sides with Schleiermacher against Hegel in associating religion with affectivity rather than logic. Such affectivity, he claims, can be more rational than reason as framed in Hegelian logic.</p></p><p>Jean-Yves Lacoste is also the author of Notes sur le temps and Le Monde et l&#39;absence d&#39;oeuvre.Jean-Yves Lacoste's Experience and the Absolute elaborates what many have wanted for a very long time: a phenomenology of the liturgy. What is it to exist liturgically? Does the place of prayer matter? How does prayer ground ethics? These questions are posed and answered with exemplary rigor. Lacoste's critique of "experience" in theology and his profound analyses of being "face-to-face with God" are essential reading. Here is a major work by a theologian of remarkable subtlety and exceptional intellectual force.

But behind O'Keeffe's bold work and celebrity was a woman misunderstood by even her most ardent admirers. This large, finely balanced biography offers an astonishingly honest portrayal of a life shrouded in myth. 16 pages of b/w illustrations, 32 pages of color.</p><p>Hunter Drohojowska-Philp is a regular contributor to a number of publications, including ARTnews, Art in America, Architectural Digest, and the Los Angeles Times. This is her first book. She lives in Los Angeles.From a publisher's perspective, some biographical subjects seem to approach the inexhaustible. As I write this review, I can see on my shelves several books each about Fitzgerald, Hemingway, JFK, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Frida Kahlo, most published within a decade of one another. Is Georgia O'Keeffe destined to join this company? Is she already there? For a woman who wanted her admirers to focus on her art, not her life, her personal story is simply too striking (and too pertinent to modern gender politics) to be ignored.<p> Laurie Lisle led the way with her appreciative portrait of the artist in 1980; Roxana Robinson took another step forward with her more critical full-length biography in 1989; and, in 1991, Benita Eisler brought O'Keeffe's relationship with photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz to a mythologizing height in O'Keeffe and Stieglitz: An American Romance. In between and after these capable writers, dozens of monographs, biographical studies and catalogue essays have explored every aspect of O'Keeffe's life, including her formative experiences in Texas, her relation to New York modernism, her ties to Stieglitz and the other men in their circle, her feminism, her anti-feminism, her New Mexico years. It could be argued, though, that all this disparate material needed to be synthesized to provide a vivid account based on newly available papers and interviews with contemporaries who had been less than forthcoming when she was alive. Lengthy, balanced and serious as it is, I am not sure Hunter Drohojowska-Philp's book is quite that.</p><p> The outlines of the story are well-known. Born in Wisconsin in 1887 to an aloof mother and a likable but emotionally unsupportive father, Georgia O'Keeffe was raised in the heartland and in Virginia. Her childhood seems to have been neither brutally deprived nor overly loving. ("I was not a favorite child," she once commented.) Moving to New York to study art when she was 20 was a pivotal decision. Between the new work she absorbed in Manhattan's more advanced galleries and her fascination with the landscape of the Southwest, acquired when she worked as a teacher in Texas from 1916 to 1918, she was as psychologically and professionally prepared to let go of the past and enter an uncharted future as any artist of her generation. </p><p> For many of us, the early watercolors and forays into color abstraction are among her most striking, original creations. Later, her precisionist city scenes, floral paintings and New Mexico landscapes achieved a tenuous but intriguing balance between representational and modernist principles, and many have become iconic images in American art. Until her death at 99, O'Keeffe remained the kind of painter she always wanted to be -- unaffiliated with any particular movement, a rare combination of severe and lyrical -- and the kind of artist mid-century America craved, a female celebrity with a tough-minded attitude about her power and persona.</p><p> Those ends were not achieved with ease. Her evolution, as Full Bloom makes clear, was a matter of fits and starts, of uncertain yearnings and a healthy crankiness about being told who and what she must be. Not surprisingly, then, some of the most engrossing parts of this book are early chapters that give us Georgia O'Keeffe before she became "Georgia O'Keeffe." Too many biographies of major artists imply an implausible greatness and unvarying progress from earliest adulthood, but that isn't a trap Drohojowska-Philp falls into. </p><p> O'Keeffe was also blessed with abundant good luck, especially in her relationships with male mentors. She studied under Arthur Wesley Dow, who urged his students to move beyond the narrow ideas about art and academic realism that dominated American life before World War I. She became involved with the avant-garde photographer Paul Strand, whose work influenced her thinking about abstraction, and -- most importantly -- with Stieglitz, who, as the most important art dealer of the day, launched her career and made possible her fame and spectacular sales. Her last, infirm years in rural New Mexico would have been much more trying had it not been for the attentions of Juan Hamilton, a companion 60 years her junior. Fiercely independent she might have been, but without these men, O'Keeffe's life would have taken a very different course.</p><p> Yet her relationships with men, especially the much-older Stieglitz, whom she married, were tumultuous. Drohojowska-Philp provides a full, absorbing account of a union marked both by affection and manipulation. Neither Stieglitz nor O'Keeffe, emotionally needy and art-obsessed, would have had much use for a conventional spouse, but neither were they able to sustain their own, less traditional commitment. For O'Keeffe their bond turned out to be a kind of Faustian bargain. She began her life with the already-married Stieglitz as "the other woman" and, once she was established as a cultural force in her own right, was in turn relegated by him to the humiliating position of betrayed wife -- within a few years of their wedding. </p><p> The author's access to the late Dorothy Norman, the married woman 40 years his junior whom Stieglitz became involved with in the 1920s until his death in 1946, was crucial in her examination of this aspect of O'Keeffe's life. For decades the wealthy and controlling Norman honed her own public image in Manhattan circles as an acolyte to a great seer, but the true picture is a little less genteel. In her need to worship at the feet of a great male ego, she seems to have been a woman of her time and class, directionless and breathlessly romantic. In her speculations to Drohojowska-Philp about O'Keeffe as a lesbian, she also comes across as robustly catty. No wonder O'Keeffe came to scorn the New York art world.</p><p> Of course, O'Keeffe was not a likable person either, to put it mildly. Her rudeness and self-absorption knew no bounds. This fact shouldn't influence how we evaluate her art (my own view is that she is a fine but limited and far from great painter) and should be equally irrelevant to her worth as a biographical subject. One problem, though, is that she wasn't always unlikable in particularly interesting ways. Chronicling every snub, every arrogant gesture, every vindictive remark is a risky approach for any biographer, and we get an enormous amount of that flattening, numbing information in Full Bloom.</p><p> Sometimes O'Keeffe's famously difficult temperament had less to do with ego and more to do with respect for her art and those who came to see it. Drohojowska-Philp describes the artist's 1966 trip to the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth to attend an exhibition of her work. Dismayed by the potted pine trees in the galleries and the glare on the glass that covered one of her best paintings, she took matters into her own hands when the curators proved unhelpful, talked her way past the guards before the museum opened the next morning, and got rid of the pines and the glass. I wouldn't describe these acts as "willful demonstrations" so much as a gutsy statement of passion and sound priorities. </p><p> The more serious problem with Full Bloom, however, is its polite "Just the facts, ma'am" quality. Drohojowska-Philp's skills as a researcher and an organizer of her extensive material are never in question. There is an admirable crispness to her prose, and she offers sound commentaries on pictures, events and relationships. Yet memorable portraiture, narrative momentum and a distinctive authorial voice -- crucial skills needed to raise a biography to the level of craft we expect from a novel or an essay -- are just not her strong points. The people we meet in this book are a remarkable and eccentric lot by anybody's standards, but she often renders them through accumulations of facts and plausible quotations. She dutifully notes pain, expectation and delight but never truly evokes them.</p><p> The book ends with a terseness O'Keeffe might have appreciated (or demanded, if she had any say in the matter), but it isn't appropriate to an immersion in a life we are meant to take as extraordinary, whose end should move us. The ashes are scattered, the estate is settled, the foundation is off and running, but where is the sense that the world is a lesser place without this woman in it? Death on the page should leave an ache. The reader's need for that kind of feeling isn't about cheap emotion or pandering to a tired myth. It's simply about gratitude for a life of struggle, originality and significant accomplishment.</p><p>Reviewed by John Loughery <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Kim Ford was recognized by the aged Seer, Ysanne, as the successor she had prophetically dreamt. Kim was initiated into the knowledge of the Seers by the water spirit, Eilathen, and presented with the Baelrath, the &#x201c;Warstone&#x201d; that Ysanne had been guarding. Kim was also shown the Circlet of Lisen, a gem that shone with its own light. The beautiful Lisen, a power of Pendaran Wood, had been the magical source and the beloved companion of Amairgen Whitebranch, the first of the mages. She had killed herself, leaping into the sea from her Tower, upon learning that Amairgen had died. Ysanne told Kim the prophecy that accompanied the Circlet: &#x201c;Who shall wear this next, after Lisen, shall have the darkest road to walk of any child of earth or stars.&#x201d; Later, as a last gesture of ultimate sacrifice on the eve of war, Ysanne, knowing Kim would have need of the old Seer&#x2019;s power in the days to come, used L�kdal, the magic dagger of the Dwarves, to kill herself&#x2014;but not before tracing a symbol on the brow of the sleeping Kim, which action enabled her to make of her own soul a gift for Kimberly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Paul Schafer and Kevin Laine were initiated in quite a different way. Paul played&#x2014;and lost&#x2014;a night game of chess with the High King in the palace of Paras Derval, during which an unexpected bond of sympathy was forged between the two. The next morning he and Kevin joined the band of the reckless Prince Diarmuid, Ailell&#x2019;s younger son, in a raid across the River Saeren to Cathal, the Garden Country. There, Diarmuid achieved his intended seduction of Sharra, the Princess of Cathal. After the company&#x2019;s return to Brennin, they passed a wild night in the Black Boar tavern. Late at night a song Kevin sang reminded Paul too acutely of the death in a car accident of Rachel Kincaid, the woman he had loved. Paul, blaming himself for the accident, which had occurred moments after Rachel had announced she was going to wed someone else, took a drastic step: he approached the High King and received Ailell&#x2019;s sanction to sacrifice himself in the King&#x2019;s stead on the Summer Tree.</p><p>The next night, the glade of the Summer Tree in the Godwood saw an epic battle. As Paul, bound on the Tree, watched helplessly, Galadan the Wolflord, who had come to claim Paul&#x2019;s life, was opposed and driven back by a mysterious grey dog. The following night&#x2014;Paul&#x2019;s third on the Tree&#x2014;a red full moon shone in the sky on a new moon night, as Dana, the Mother Goddess, granted Paul release from his guilt, by showing that he had not, in fact, subconsciously willed the accident that had killed Rachel. As Paul wept, rain finally fell over Brennin. Paul, though, did not die. He was taken down from the Tree alive by Jaelle, the High Priestess of Dana. Henceforth Paul would carry another name: Pwyll Twiceborn, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p><p>By now it was clear that an epochal confrontation was at hand: Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller, defeated a thousand years before and bound under the great mountain, Rangat, had freed himself and had caused the mountain to explode with a hand of fire to proclaim that fact.</p><p>His freedom was to have immediate consequences for Jennifer Lowell, the fourth of the strangers. In Paras Derval she had witnessed an unsettling incident during a children&#x2019;s counting game. A young girl, Leila, had &#x201c;called&#x201d; a boy named Finn to &#x201c;take the Longest Road&#x201d; for the third time that summer. No one, not even Jaelle, who had also been watching, knew exactly what that meant, though Jaelle was quick to enlist Leila as an acolyte in the Temple. The next day, riding outside the town walls, Jennifer met Brendel of the lios alfar&#x2014;the Children of Light&#x2014;and a party of his people. She spent the night in the woods with them, and in the darkness they were attacked. Concerned about the arrival of the five strangers, Rakoth Maugrim had Galadan and Metran&#x2014;the traitorous First Mage of Brennin&#x2014;abduct Jennifer. She was bound to the back of the black swan, Avaia, and borne north to Rakoth&#x2019;s fortress of Starkadh.</p><p>Meanwhile, the terrifying explosion of the mountain had caused the death of the aged High King. This led to a tense confrontation between Diarmuid and his brother, Aileron&#x2014;who had been disguised as Ysanne&#x2019;s servant since his exile. The potentially violent situation was ended by Diarmuid&#x2019;s voluntarily relinquishing his claim to the throne, but not before he&#x2019;d received a knife in the shoulder, courtesy of Sharra of Cathal, who had come to Brennin to seek vengeance on him for the deception that had led to her seduction.</p><p>In the meantime, Dave Martyniuk, the last of the five strangers, had been separated from the others in the crossing to Fionavar. He ended up far to the north among the Dalrei, the &#x201c;Riders,&#x201d; on the Plain, and found himself drawn into the life of the third tribe, led by Ivor, their Chieftain.</p><p>Ivor&#x2019;s young son, Tabor, fasting in the forest for a vision of his totem animal, dreamt a seemingly impossible creature: a winged, chestnut unicorn. Three nights later, at the edge of the Great Wood, Pendaran, he met and flew upon this creature of his fast, Imraith-Nimphais&#x2014;a double-edged gift of the Goddess, born of the red full moon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dave was escorted toward Brennin by a party of Dalrei led by Ivor&#x2019;s older son, Levon. The company was ambushed by a great number of the evil svart alfar, and only Dave, Levon, and a third Dalrei, Torc, survived by riding into the darkness of Pendaran Wood. The trees and spirits of Pendaran, hating all men since the loss of the beautiful Lisen of the Wood a thousand years before, plotted the death of the three men, but they were saved by the intervention of Flidais, a diminutive forest power, who claimed, among other things, to know the answers to all the riddles in all the worlds, save one: the name by which the &#x201c;Warrior&#x201d; could be summoned. As it happened, the search for this name was one of the tasks Ysanne had left with Kimberly.</p><p>Flidais sent word to Ceinwen, the capricious, green-clad goddess of the Hunt, who had taken a special liking to Dave. The goddess arranged for the three friends to awaken safely on the southern edge of the Great Wood in the morning.</p><p>She did more. She also caused Dave to find a long-lost object of power: Owein&#x2019;s Horn. Levon, who had been taught by wise old Gereint, the blind shaman of his tribe, then found the Cave of the Sleepers nearby&#x2014;a cave wherein Owein and the kings of the Wild Hunt lay asleep.</p><p>The three friends rode south with this knowledge to Paras Derval, in time to arrive for the first council of Aileron&#x2019;s reign. The council was interrupted twice. The first time, by the arrival of Brock, a Dwarf from Banir Tal who knelt before Matt S�ren&#x2014;once King of the Dwarves&#x2014;and proffered the terrible tidings that the Dwarves, under the leadership of two brothers, Kaen and Bl�d, had helped the Unraveller to free himself by treacherously breaking the wardstone of Eridu, thus preventing any warning of Rakoth&#x2019;s stirring under the mountain. They had also found and delivered to Rakoth the Cauldron of Khath Meigol, which had the power to raise the newly dead.</p><p>In the midst of this terrifying recitation, Kimberly suddenly saw&#x2014;in a vision shaped by the Baelrath&#x2014;Jennifer being raped and tortured by Rakoth in his fortress of Starkadh. She gathered Dave, Paul, and Kevin around her, reached out for Jennifer with the wild power of her ring, and drew the five of them out of Fionavar back to their own world.</p><p>And so ended <i>The Summer Tree.</i></p><p><i>The Wandering Fire</i> picked up the story some six months later, in November and back in Toronto, with Kimberly waiting for the dream that would give her the Warrior&#x2019;s summoning name. Jennifer, badly scarred in her soul and carrying the child of Rakoth Maugrim&#x2014;having vowed to give birth to that child as her answer to the Dark&#x2014;was brought early to her time by a sudden crossing back to Fionavar. The crossing was achieved by Paul when the two of them were threatened by Galadan, who had crossed to their world in pursuit of Paul.</p><p>In Fionavar, Jennifer&#x2019;s child, Darien, was left to be secretly fostered in the house of Vae and Shahar, the parents of Finn&#x2014;the boy called by the children&#x2019;s counting game to &#x201c;take the Longest Road.&#x201d; The only persons informed of the secret were the priestesses of Dana, because Paul and Jennifer needed Jaelle&#x2019;s magic to send them home.</p><p>The following spring Kim finally had the dream for which she had been waiting. As a result, the five traveled to Stonehenge where Kim raised the spirit of Uther Pendragon by the power of the Baelrath and compelled him to name his son&#x2019;s resting place. Kim then went alone, by the magic she carried, to Glastonbury Tor and there&#x2014;having first sent the others ahead to Fionavar&#x2014;she drew the Warrior, Arthur, from his rest by the summoning name: Childslayer. The name was an echo of the sin Arthur had committed in his youth after discovering his inadvertent incest with his sister. Kim and the Warrior followed the others to Paras Derval.</p><p>An icy winter gripped Fionavar, even as midsummer approached&#x2014;a winter so terrible that Fordaetha, the Ice Queen of R�k, was able to come as far south as Paras Derval. She almost killed Paul in the Black Boar tavern before he succeeded in driving her back north. It was decided in council that Jaelle and the mages and Kimberly would join with Gereint, the old shaman, in an attempt to magically probe the source of the killing winter&#x2014;a necessary prelude to trying to end it.</p><p>In the meantime the dimensions of Arthur Pendragon&#x2019;s tragedy were beginning to take shape as it became clear (to Brendel of the lios alfar, first of everyone) who Jennifer Lowell really was: Guinevere, beloved of Arthur and of Lancelot. Marred by her suffering in Starkadh, Jennifer withdrew to the sanctuary of Dana with Jaelle. It was Jaelle who explained that Vae and Finn had taken Darien (who was growing with the unnatural rapidity of all the andain&#x2014;children of mortals and gods) to Ysanne&#x2019;s cottage by the lake. There, Darien, seeming now to be a child of five years old, was growing up in the loving care of his foster mother and brother, who were troubled by two things: a power which caused his blue eyes to flash red, and an awareness that the child was drawn by voices in the storms of winter.</p><p>On the Plain the Dalrei were hard-pressed. The winter had rendered the graceful eltor&#x2014;the creatures the Dalrei hunted and depended upon&#x2014;awkward and ungainly in the snow, which made them easy prey for Galadan&#x2019;s wolves. Ivor&#x2014;now Aven, or &#x201c;Father&#x201d; of all the Dalrei&#x2014;had herded the eltor down to the southeastern corner of the vast Plain, and there the gathered tribes guarded them as best they could. Until one attack included great numbers of the hideous urgach mounted upon six-legged monsters called slaug. Only the intervention of Diarmuid of Brennin, with Dave and Kevin in his company, saved the Dalrei from the first wave of the mounted urgach. And only the appearance of Ivor&#x2019;s son Tabor, riding Imraith-Nimphais, his deadly, winged mount with the shining horn, saved them from the second, larger wave. Ivor was painfully aware of the effect such flight had on Tabor, drawing him ever farther from the world of men.</p><p>Shortly after, back in Brennin, another new strand entered the Tapestry. At the urging of Levon, Ivor&#x2019;s older son&#x2014;and having the reluctant agreement of Loren&#x2014;Kim and Dave, the bearers of what Levon thought to be the elements of an ancient verse that spoke of the waking of the Wild Hunt, went with a number of companions to the place at the edge of Pendaran Wood where the Cave of the Sleepers lay. The Baelrath shattered the stone at the cave mouth and then Dave&#x2019;s horn summoned forth Owein and the seven kings of the Hunt. With the shadowy sky kings wailing &#x201c;Where is the child?&#x201d; a child did, indeed, step forth to become one of the Wild Hunt: it was Finn, and this was the Longest Road to which he had been called.</p><p>Most of the company, including Shalhassan the Supreme Lord of Cathal, and Sharra, his daughter, who had arrived from the south with reinforcements, made their way the next morning to Gwen Ystrat, the province of the Goddess; partly to meet Gereint, the shaman, there, partly in response to a report from Audiart, Jaelle&#x2019;s second in command, that the province was being beset by wolves. The company was led by the grey dog that had saved Paul on the Summer Tree, and who turned out to be Cavall, Arthur&#x2019;s hunting dog. They passed into the province of the Mother amid ice and snow on the day before Maidaladan&#x2014;Midsummer&#x2019;s Eve&#x2014;with all the ancient, erotic, blood magic such a night implied. That evening, with the aid of the other magic wielde...</p></p><h2>Prom</h2><p><p>The high school prom is an American tradition, a rite of passage, and one of the most important rituals of youth in this country.

An epic romance, a philosophical argument and an honest and searing portrayal of what it means to be a woman, this is Simone de Beauvoir&#39;s most famous and profound novel. De Beauvoir sketches the volatile intellectual and political climate of post-war France with amazing deftness and insight, peopling her story with fictionalisations of the most important figures of the era, such as Camus, Sartre and Nelson Algren. Her novel examines the painful split between public and private life that characterised the female experience in the mid-20th century, and addresses the most difficult questions of gender and choice. It is an astonishing work of intellectual athleticism, yet also a moving romance, a love story of passion and depth. Long out of print, this masterpiece is now reissued as part of the Harper Perennial Modern Classics series so that a whole new generation can discover de Beauvoir&#39;s magic.</p><p>Simon de Beauvoir was born in Paris in 1908. A close friend of the writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and well-known as a leader of the Existentialist movement in Paris. Her famous feminist work, The Second Sex, was hailed as a landmark study of women, and her novels, including The Woman Destroyed and She Came to Stay, have become well-loved classics. She died in 1968.`A remarkable novel.&#39; Iris Murdoch, Sunday Times `A dazzling panorama of the giants of the Left Bank.&#39; New Statesman `The characters, especially the women, are uninhibited and sometimes predatory.

Cheryl Mattingly&#39;s ethnography of the practice of occupational therapy in a North American hospital investigates the complex interconnections between narrative and experience in clinical work. Viewing the world of disability as a socially constructed experience, it presents fascinatingly detailed case studies of clinical interactions between occupational therapists and patients, many of them severely injured and disabled, and illustrates the diverse ways in which an ordinary clinical interchange is transformed into a dramatic experience governed by a narrative plot. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including anthropological studies of narrative and ritual, literary theory, phenomenology and hermeneutics, this book develops a narrative theory of social action and experience. While most contemporary theories of narrative presume that narratives impose an artificial coherence upon lived experience, Mattingly argues for a revision of the classic mimetic position. If narrative offers a correspondence to lived experience, she contends, the dominant formal feature which connects the two is not narrative coherence but narrative drama. Moving and sophisticated, this book is an innovative contribution to the study of modern institutions and to anthropological theory.</p><p>There is growing interest in &#39;therapeutic narratives&#39;, stories that help to explain why people need to create stories, and what in the particular structure of clinical practice gives therapists and patients practical reasons for constructing stories with a specific narrative form. This ethnography of the practice of occupational therapy in a North American hospital reveals how participants transform ordinary clinical interchange into a standardized story-line. It is an innovative contribution to anthropological theory."Cheryl Mattingly has produced a little masterpiece. Her book brings anthropological theory to bear in a most subtle and knowledgeable way on how occupational therapists help patients who are so severely disabled that they are no longer able to live their lives with the ordinariness and banality to which we all become accustomed. Her focus is principally upon how therapists and patients together create a new and workable life narrative that restores meaning and order to a shattered life. She manages this task with a combination of anthropological astuteness and human compassion that is gripping. And along the way she succeeds in shedding fresh light on such ancient riddles as how life imitates (narrative) art while such art remains in some respects an imitation of life. This is a book not just for the medical anthropologist or the occupational therapist but for human scientists at large!" Jerome Bruner<br><br>"Mattingly provides the richest discussion to date of the relevance of narrative theory for many of the most crucial issues of contemporary studies of culture. Plot, motive, desire, sufferance, reversal and transformation are all found to be features of therapeutic 'rituals of the everyday' - and by extension of the achievement of 'significant experience' in the most ordinary social routines. Exquisite reflections on philosophical and literary texts, juxtaposed with captivating stories from the clinic, this is a work of maturity and great importance." Byron Good and Mary-Jo DelVecchio Good<br><br>"Mattingly has clearly moved the conversation about narrative in clinical settings forward. Her accounts and analysis are often so subtle and sensitive that the text moves us in ways that go beyond `purely' academic writing to experiences that enrich our lives as well as our understandings. Surely this is the most important work we can do in this field." Barbara A. Sherman Heifferon, Literature and Medicine<br><br>"...this is an impressive book in terms of the critique of existing theory and the deep analysis narrative can provide....This book encourages reflection into personal practice as well as to listening to the narratives of patients....an excellent text to use as part of anadvanced clinical reasoning course."

This superb anthology, a diverse and illuminating collection of primary documents and stories by Chinese Americans, provides an intimate and textured history of the Chinese in America from their arrival during the California Gold Rush to the present. Among the documents are letters, speeches, testimonies, oral histories, personal memoirs, poems, essays, and folksongs; many have never been published before or have been translated into English for the first time. They bring to life the diverse voices of immigrants and American-born; laborers, merchants, and professionals; ministers and students; housewives and prostitutes; and community leaders and activists. Together, they provide insight into immigration, work, family and social life, and the longstanding fight for equality and inclusion. Featuring photographs and extensive introductions to the documents written by three leading Chinese American scholars, this compelling volume offers a panoramic perspective on the Chinese American experience and opens new vistas on American social, cultural, and political history.<br><br>"A Teacher's Guide" to <i>Chinese American Voices </i>is available from the Stanford Program on Intercultural and Cross-cultural Education at Stanford University.</p><p>"Skillfully selected, translated, and annotated, this compelling compendium of voices bear witness to the diversity and depth of the Chinese American experience and, significantly, its indispensable centrality to American life and history."&#x2015;Gary Y.

This text provides a detailed exploration and examination into the journeys of community corrections offenders. Moving beyond other texts on this subject, this book examines the literature on all types of community corrections offenders not just probationers and parolees as well as offender reentry experiences for all types of offenders (i.e., adult and juvenile). Additionally, discussion of the role of gender, race, and social class is included in the context of explaining experiences and how various factors and programs can contribute to, or stifle, successful offender reintegration.<br><br>Integrating the most recent research on various topics such as community corrections officer roles and assessment, this book offers what other texts in community corrections fail to.

For instance, students will be exposed to pop culture case references to pique their interest (e.g., 50 Cent, Lindsay Lohan &amp; Chris Brown) and other relevant local and national cases that will help them to synthesize the material.

After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to political activism, work that would see her assisting in the trade union movement, taking the side of the Anarchists known as the Durruti Column in the Spanish Civil War, and spending more than a year working as a laborer, mostly in auto factories, so she could better understand the working class. Taking a path that was unusual among twentieth-century left-leaning intellectuals, she became more religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. Weil wrote throughout her life, though most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. The exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. She died in August 1943 from cardiac failure at the age of 34 but whether it was from a lifetime of battling illness and frailty, or from refusing to eat remains unanswered. In the 1950s and 1960s, her work became famous on continental Europe and throughout the English-speaking world. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields. A meta study from the University of Calgary found that between 1995 and 2012 over 2,500 new scholarly works had been published about her. Albert Camus described her as &#34;the only great spirit of our times&#34;. The author, Robert Coles (b. 1929) is an American author, child psychiatrist, and professor emeritus at Harvard University.</p><p>The spiritual characteristics and influence of these two women, rather than their historical or even psychological lives, concern psychiatrist and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Coles. Himself a Catholic convert and personally acquainted with co-founder of the Catholic Worker Day, Cole gives us a biography that reads more like a meditation on a mentor in faith than a dynamic study of someone's habits of living. Because he did not meet Weil, Coles is more dependent on his analytic skills in his portrait of her faith life whose details he gathers from her writings and his discussions with her brother. In both cases, Coles utilizes Anna Freud's psychiatric observations on Day and Weil but for the most part fails to go beneath the surface characteristics upon which he and Freud seem to agree. Unlike other titles in the "Radcliffe Biography " series, such as Joseph Lash's definitive Helen and Teacher ( LJ 5/15/80), Coles expects his reader to bring background knowledge of his subjects' lives to his texts. In short, these two books reveal more about Coles's religious temperament and development than about Day or Weil. More complete accounts of their lives are available in both their autobiographical writings and in numerous recent critical commentaries. Coles's books seem best suited to inspirational collections.Francisca Goldsmith, Golden Gate Univ. Lib., San Francisco<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.A new study of this brilliant, perplexing and "unnerving" French thinker and moral heroine, who died in 1943 at age 34, is certainly called for, and this perceptive one does her justice. Coles, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and author of the Pulitzer Prizewinning Children of Crisis, examines Weil's radical sociopolitical views, astringent moral philosophy and mystical Christianity, as revealed with penetrating lucidity in such posthumous collections of her writings as The Need for Roots and Gravity and Grace. He covers the facts of Weil's brief life (her death from TB was precipitated by her refusal of food) and ponders her strange ambivalence toward Judaism and Catholicism. Also included are interesting discussions on Weil that took place between the author and Anna Freud. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function</h2><p>With Saladin, students make connections through learning outcomes and assessments, integrated media, and a writing style that clearly depicts anatomy and physiology processes.

The book reviews different strategies for reducing recidivism and describes how the evidence for effectiveness is assessed. Thousands of studies were examined in order to identify those of sufficient scientific rigor to enable conclusions to be drawn about the impact of various interventions, policies and programs on recidivism. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed to further examine these results. This book assesses the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation programs (e.g., education, life skills, employment, cognitive behavioral), treatment for different types of offenders (e.g. sex offenders, batterers, juveniles), management and treatment of drug-involved offenders (e.g., drug courts, therapeutic communities, outpatient drug treatment) and punishment, control and surveillance interventions (boot camps, intensive supervision, electronic monitoring). Through her extensive research, MacKenzie illustrates which of these programs are most effective and why.</p><p>This 2006 book assesses the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, specialized treatment for different types of offenders, management and treatment of drug-involved offenders and punishment, control and surveillance interventions to provide an intensive review of correctional interventions and programs. Through extensive research, MacKenzie illustrates which of these programs are most effective and why.Doris Layton MacKenzie is Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland.

It is possible to read Japanese knowing only a limited number of kanji, but it is not possible with only a limited number of katakana or hiragana-one must know all of them. <em>Let's Learn Hiragana</em>, and its companion volume <em>Let's Learn Katakana</em>, is a textbook that introduces the learner to the basics of one of these fundamental Japanese scripts. Being a workbook, it contains all the exercises that allow the student to master hiragana by the time the book has been finished. <em>Let's Learn Hiragana</em> is a classic in the field, and the huge number of students that have used it successfully is a sign of its preeminence as a self-study guide.</p><p><b>JOYCE KOSAKA MITAMURA</b> was an experienced and respected educator who taught Japanese in California for many years.Preface <p>The Japanese writing system is so different from the English alphabet that written Japanese may seem to be more complicated than it really is. Actually, Hiragana symbols, which comprise the basis of Japanese writing, are not difficult to learn. By using this workbook as a study guide, the student should be able to learn all the Hiragana symbols easily, in a relatively short time. </p><p>This workbook is specially designed and organized so that the beginning student, who is studying Japanese as a foreign language, can learn Hiragana through self-study, without the aid of an instructor. Each section contains sufficient explanation and exercises to enable students to study and practice on their own until proficiency has been attained. Consequently, the use of this workbook will eliminate the need for extensive writing drills in class. The class time can then be utilized more effectively for matters that require the presence of an instructor, such as question-and-answer type oral drills. </p><p>This book is composed of four chapters: chapter 1 introduces the forty-six basic Hiragana and the sixty-one modified symbols which are derived from them. Chapter 2 explains how to write words using Hiragana symbols. Chapter 3 shows how to write sentences, and chapter 4 contains review exercises. The derivation of Hiragana is presented in Appendix B. </p><p>In learning any foreign language, it is important to place equal emphasis on the four skills: hearing, speaking, reading and writing. Therefore, it is an essential prerequisite to become very familiar with Hiragana for the eventual mastery of Japanese. The student will find that diligent use of this workbook will be of great benefit in the quest for proficiency in Japanese. </p><p>Throughout this workbook, the Modified Hepburn System is used, for the most part, to Romanize Japanese words and sentences. This widely used system comes the closest to representing the correct Japanese sounds and facilitates learning Japanese pronunciation. It is also known as the Hyojun, or standard, System. (The original Hepburn System is no longer used, so references to the "Hepburn System" actually mean the Modified Hepburn System. The two are nearly identical, differing in only a few points.)....</p></p><h2>The Poems of FranCois Villon</h2><p>Former library book with usual stamps and stickers.

But what should we do with it today? </b></p> <p>The KJV beautifully rendered the Scriptures into the language of turn-of-the-seventeenth-century England. Even today the King James is the most widely read Bible in the United States. The rich cadence of its Elizabethan English is recognized even by non-Christians. But English has changed a great deal over the last 400 years&#x2015;and in subtle ways that very few modern readers will recognize. In <i>Authorized</i> Mark L. Ward, Jr. shows what exclusive readers of the KJV are missing as they read God's word.</p> <p>In their introduction to the King James Bible, the translators tell us that Christians must "heare CHRIST speaking unto them in their mother tongue." In <i>Authorized</i> Mark Ward builds a case for the KJV translators' view that English Bible translations should be readable by what they called "the very vulgar"&#x2015;and what we would call "the man on the street."</p></p><p><b>Mark Ward</b> received his PhD in New Testament Interpretation from Bob Jones University in 2012. He now serves the church as a Logos Pro, writing weekly on Bible study for the Logos Talk Blog and training users in the use of Logos Bible Software. He is the author of multiple high school Bible textbooks, including <i>Biblical Worldview: Creation, Fall, Redemption</i>. He blogs at byfaithweunderstand.com."This lightly written and frequently amusing book gently hides the competent scholarship that underlies it. For those who are convinced of the superiority of the KJV, whether for stylistic, cultural, pedagogical, theological, or traditional reasons, this is the book to read. Mercifully, Dr. Ward does not pummel his readers or sneer at those who take another position. Patiently, chapter by chapter, example by example, he makes his case&#x2015;all of his work geared toward fostering more and better Bible reading. Highly recommended." (D. A. Carson, research professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (Deerfield, IL) 2018-01-04)<br><br>"Mark Ward's <em>Authorized: The Use and Misuse of the King James Bible</em> is a cogent, concise, clear, and helpful book on the subject of Bible translations. It is full of information about how language changes and doesn't change, and full of wisdom about how Christians should respond to these processes. The book is useful both for beginning Bible students and for linguists." (John Frame, professor of systematic theology and philosophy emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary (Orlando) 2018-01-04)<br><br>"Mark Ward's book on the King James Version is first of all a delightful book to read. I had a hard time putting it down once I started it. Another virtue of the book is that Ward grew up loving the KJV, and thus we have a friendly criticism of its use today instead of an attack from an outsider. Ward is convincing in arguing that the KJV should not be one's primary Bible today since it is too antiquated for contemporary readers. In fact, he shows that the KJV translators would agree with that assessment, for they were excellent scholars who desired to translate the Bible into the vernacular. As Ward says, there is no need to dispense with the KJV altogether, and the best practice is to use a number of translations, and thankfully we are blessed with many fine English translations today." (Tom Schreiner, professor of New Testament interpretation, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (Louisville, KY) 2018-01-04)<br><br>"Ward combines good writing and common sense to explain why English speakers today should both appreciate the KJV and benefit from excellent modern translations." (Andrew David Naselli, associate professor of New Testament and theology, Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary (Minneapolis) 2018-01-04)<br><br>"Can anything useful still be said on the use of the King James Version? Yes, and Mark Ward has said it. Authorized makes a contribution to the discussion by avoiding the topic of Koine Greek textual criticism and focusing on something every reader of the KJV is supposed to know: English." (Kevin Bauder, research professor of systematic theology, Central Baptist Theological Seminary (Minneapolis) 2018-01-04)<br><br>"This volume by Mark Ward is everything a book should be that deals with a controversial topic like the abiding value of the King James Version. It is engaging, readable, often humorous, and clever in its arguments. Most importantly, it is accurate in its facts, balanced in its presentation, and irenic in tone. I would highly recommend it not only for those involved in the KJV-only debate, but for anyone with an interest in Bible translation."

Yet even as the social, political, and economic history of Renaissance Italy inspires exciting and innovative scholarship, the study of its intellectual history has grown less appealing, and our understanding of its substance and significance remains largely defined by the work of nineteenth-century thinkers. In <i>The Lost Italian Renaissance</i>, historian and literary scholar Christopher Celenza argues that serious interest in the intellectual life of Renaissance Italy can be reinvigorated&#x2015;and the nature of the Renaissance itself reconceived&#x2015;by recovering a major part of its intellectual and cultural activity that has been largely ignored since the Renaissance was first "discovered": the vast body of works&#x2015;literary, philosophical, poetic, and religious&#x2015;written in Latin.</p><p>Produced between the mid-fourteenth and the early sixteenth centuries by major figures such as Leonardo Bruni, Lorenzo Valla, Marsilio Ficino, and Leon Battista Alberti, as well as minor but interesting thinkers like Lapo da Castiglionchio the Younger, this literature was initially overlooked by scholars of the Renaissance because they were not written in the vernacular Italian which alone was seen as was the supreme expression of a culture. This lack of attention, which continued well into the twentieth century, has led interpreters to misread key aspects of the Renaissance. Offering a flexible theoretical framework within which to understand these Latin texts, Celenza explains why these "lost" sources are distinctive and why they are worthy of study.</p><p>What will we really find among the Latin texts of the Renaissance? First, Celenza contends, there are a limited number of intellectuals who deserve a place in any canon of the period, and without whom our literary and philosophical heritage is diminished. Second, and more commonly, this literature establishes the intellectual traditions from which such well-known vernacular writers as Machiavelli and Castiglione emerge. And third, these Latin texts may contain strands of intellectual life that have been lost altogether. A groundbreaking work of intellectual history, <i>The Lost Italian Renaissance</i> uncovers a priceless intellectual legacy suggests provocative new avenues of research.</p></p><p><p>In this groundbreaking work of intellectual history, Christopher Celenza argues that serious interest in the intellectual life of Renaissance Italy can be reinvigorated-and the nature of the Renaissance itself reconceived-by recovering a major part of its intellectual and cultural activity that has been largely ignored since the Renaissance was first "discovered": the vast body of works-literary, philosophical, poetic, and religious-written in Latin by major figures such as Leonardo Bruni, Lorenzo Valla, Marsilio Ficino, and Leon Battista Alberti, as well as minor but interesting thinkers like Lapo da Castiglionchio the Younger.</p><p><b>Christopher S.

Ammons's poem with the unforgettable title is a defense of meaning&#x2015;'this,' the poet says, 'are awash in ideality.' <em>Garbage</em> is an epic of ideas: all life&#x2015;not that of human beings alone, but every species&#x2015;is shown to be part of an ultimate reality. Eternity is here and now. The argument ranges widely with a wealth of images taken from science, and the world around us, the writing by turns impassioned and witty. For power of the thought and language, the poem takes its place alongside Whitman's <em>Song of Myself</em>&#x2015;an American classic."&#x2015;Citation for the 1993 National Book Award for Poetry</p><p>"Garbage," A.R. Ammons writes in this book-length poem, "has to be the poem of our time because / garbage is spiritual, believable enough / to get our attention, getting in the way..." Talky and playful, the couplets of the National Book Award-winning <i>Garbage</i> propel one through the trash dump of 20th-century meaning, as well as into the past and future, where "millennia jiggle in your eyes at night." This project, by turns wryly self-deprecating and densely philosophical, places Ammons in the company of such recent epic funnymen as John Ashbery, Ronald Johnson, and, very self-consciously, William Carlos Williams. Like any good epic, the poem begins in doubt, with Ammons wondering whether to write the book or simply retire and live a life of leisure on Social Security (plus a surely ample pension from his longtime Cornell University professorship). Like John Milton in the preamble to his epic, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Ammons uses the metaphor of a tree to focus his poetic ambition. "I mean," he writes, "take my yard maple--put out in the free / and open--has overgrown, its trunk / split down from a high fork ... The fat tree, unable to stop pouring it on, overfed and overgrew ... It just / goes to show you: moderation imposed is better / than no moderation at all." Indeed, the poem's 121 pages seem at times nothing more than an attempt to buoy the moment between two extremes: exuberant falsehoods at one end of the scale, cynical platitudes on the other. This "moderation" has served as Ammons' dominant aesthetic during his long poetic career, though <i>Garbage</i>'s length and epic ambitions disrupt his trademark austerity. Despite his tangential questioning of reality and time, the poem's ultimate wisdom lies in how it imagines the actively good person, one who sees that <blockquote> ...life, life is like a poem: the moment it<br> begins, it begins to end: the tension this<br> <p> establishes makes every move and movement, every<br> gap and stumble, every glide and rise significant<br> </p></blockquote> In a time when most poetry is about loss, Ammons wanders through our community junkyard and, with his good eye, points out what's valuable, and tells us, in his trustworthy tone, why. <i>--Edward Skoog</i>A. R. Ammons&#x2019;s (1926&#x2013;2001) was a two-time winner of the National Book Award and the recipient of a National Book Critics Circle Award. His many additional honors include the Academy of American Poets&#x2019; Wallace Stevens Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Poetry Society of America&#x2019;s Robert Frost Medal, the Ruth Lilly Prize, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur Foundations.</p><h2>Covenant and God&#39;s Purpose for the World (Short Studies in Biblical Theology)</h2><p>&#x201c;Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.&#x201d; &#x2014;Genesis 17:4 Throughout the Bible, God has related to his people through covenants.

Thomas Schreiner manages to capture both the fine detail and the broad sweep of the covenantal shape of the Bible concisely, faithfully, and irenically. This book may be short, but it is fresh and deeply profound. I know of no better introduction to this vital area of biblical theology.

The resulting work is this brilliant twist-off from Waters&#39; absurd, comic view of life, and the images are as funny and delightfully edged as the very best of his films. Waters shakes the fantasies of normalcy into a new, often delicious, taste of Heaven. 165 photos, 150 in color.</p><p>John Waters has been thumbing his nose at Hollywood for more than 30 years, creating movies that are both shocking and hilarious. Now he reveals another obsession, yet another string to his artistic bow. In this collection of photographs, Waters uses his camera to "re-direct" his favorite movies, juxtaposing images to create works that explore, expand upon, and sometimes overturn the intentions of the original directors. In <i>Susan Slade</i>, for example, he distills an early 1960s melodrama into 16 photographs. The resulting images manage somehow to combine kitschy appeal with a degree of emotional impact that transcends that of the film itself. Waters also works with images from his own life and movies--including a sequence filmed in 1966 where Divine plays Jackie Kennedy in a reenactment of JFK's assassination. In another bravura performance, Liz Taylor is transformed through plastic surgery into Waters himself. <p> Waters admits that his project is to photograph "a favorite movie the way <i>I</i> want to remember it, no matter what the original director had in mind."

Chandrasekhar analyses some 150 propositions which form a direct chain leading to Newton's formulation of his universal law of gravitation. In each case, Newton's proofs are arranged in a linear sequence of equations and arguments, avoiding the need to unravel the necessarily convoluted style of Newton's connected prose. In almost every case, a modern version of the proofs is given to bring into sharp focus the beauty, clarity, and breathtaking economy of Newton's methods. This book will stimulate great interest and debate among the scientific community, illuminating the brilliance of Newton's work under the steady gaze of Chandrasekhar's rare perception.<br></p><p>S.

More specifically, he would read a proposition and then before going on to Newton's proof, would try to derive his own. Chandrasekhar points out that although he has 300 extra years of knowledge at his disposal, in virtually every case his proofs fell short of Newton's. Reading Newton became for Chandrasekhar a sustained epiphany. 'The view of science that he exhibits, the clarity with which he writes, the number of new things he finds, manifest a physical and mathematical insight of which there is no parallel in science at any time.' It is common knowledge that Newton invented calculus as well as seminal theories of gravity and optics. But Chandrasekhar argues that the <em>Principia</em> contains other achievements that have been overlooked."--<em>Scientific</em> <em>American</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The High School Life of a Fudanshi Vol. 1 (The High School Life of a Fudanshi, 1)</h2><p><p><b>An all new comedy about one man&#x2019;s obsession with BL!</b></p><p> Ryo Sakaguchi has a deep, dark secret: he&#x2019;s a <i>fudanshi</i>&#x2015;a straight boy obsessed with boys&#x2019; love (BL), the genre of stories revolving around the romance between two men.

These study guides will lead local congregations to abandon secular methodologies for church growth and instead rely on Christ&#x2019;s principles for developing healthy, God-honoring assemblies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Carl J. Broggi</strong>, Senior Pastor, Community Bible Church, Beaufort, South Carolina; President, Search the Scriptures Radio Ministry</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone who loves Jesus will love what Jesus loves. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus loves the church. He knows about and cares for individual churches and wants them to be spiritually healthy and vibrant. Not only has Jesus laid down his life for the church but he has also given many instructions in his Word regarding how churches are to live and function in the world. This series of Bible studies by 9Marks shows how Scripture teaches these things. Any Christian who works through this curriculum, preferably with other believers, will be helped to see in fresh ways the wisdom, love, and power of God in establishing the church on earth. These studies are biblical, practical, and accessible. I highly recommend this curriculum as a useful tool that will help any church embrace its calling to display the glory of God to a watching world.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas Ascol,</strong> Executive Director, Founders Ministries; Pastor, Grace Baptist Church, Cape Coral, Florida</p></p><h2>Rules of Thumb</h2><p><i>Rules of Thumb</i> is a concise, user-friendly, and affordable handbook developed around students' real writing needs.

Excerpt: ...also a solidity of aspect that enhances by contrast the graceful lines of the foliage of a clump of the great Japanese striped grass Eulalia, which stands within a few feet of it, seven feet high, shooting upright, but with the ends of the leaves recurved. Snapdragons, tall white and tall yellow, spire up five feet high, following the earlier Foxgloves. At the back is the pretty pink Dahlia Asia with sulphur and pale pink Hollyhocks. A little further along, and staked out so as to take the place of the clumps of Verbascum Chaixii that were so fine at the end of June, is Dahlia Mrs. Hawkins--palest yellow with a slight pink flush. Forward is a group of a Pentstemon of palest pink colouring named Spitzberg, that 1 had from Messrs. Barr&#39;s nursery, then a patch or two of palest blue Spiderwort, and, quite to the front; in any spaces there may be among the grey foliage, Lobelia &#34; Cobalt Blue,&#34; the taller Lobelia tenuior, and the pretty little blue-flowered Cape Daisy, Agathea calestis. The whole border is backed by a stone wall eleven feet high, now fully clothed with shrubs and plants that take their place in the colour scheme, either for tint of bloom or mass of foliage. Thus the red-leaved Claret Vine shows as background to the rich red region, and Robinia hispida stands where its pink clusters will tell rightly; Choisya and Cistus cyprius where their dark foliage and white bloom will be of value; the greyish foliage and abundant pale lilac blossom of Abutilon vitifolium in the grey and purple region, and the pale green foliage of the deciduous Magnolia conspicua showing as a background to the tender blue of a charming pale Delphinium. The shrubs and plants on the wall are not all there because they are things rare and precious or...</p><p></p><h2>The New Media Reader (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A sourcebook of historical written texts, video documentation, and working programs that form the foundation of new media.</b></p><p>This reader collects the texts, videos, and computer programs&#x2015;many of them now almost impossible to find&#x2015;that chronicle the history and form the foundation of the still-emerging field of new media. General introductions by Janet Murray and Lev Manovich, along with short introductions to each of the texts, place the works in their historical context and explain their significance. The texts were originally published between World War II&#x2015;when digital computing, cybernetic feedback, and early notions of hypertext and the Internet first appeared&#x2015;and the emergence of the World Wide Web&#x2015;when they entered the mainstream of public life. The texts are by computer scientists, artists, architects, literary writers, interface designers, cultural critics, and individuals working across disciplines. The contributors include (chronologically) Jorge Luis Borges, Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, Ivan Sutherland, William S. Burroughs, Ted Nelson, Italo Calvino, Marshall McLuhan, Jean Baudrillard, Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Bill Viola, Sherry Turkle, Richard Stallman, Brenda Laurel, Langdon Winner, Robert Coover, and Tim Berners-Lee. The CD accompanying the book contains examples of early games, digital art, independent literary efforts, software created at universities, and home-computer commercial software. Also on the CD is digitized video, documenting new media programs and artwork for which no operational version exists. One example is a video record of Douglas Engelbart's first presentation of the mouse, word processor, hyperlink, computer-supported cooperative work, video conferencing, and the dividing up of the screen we now call non-overlapping windows; another is documentation of Lynn Hershman's Lorna, the first interactive video art installation.</p></p><p>Noah Wardrip-Fruin is Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

This approach illustrates the standard elementary techniques of solution of differential equations. Precise and clear-cut statements of fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems allow understanding of their role in this subject. A strong numerical approach emphasizes that the effective and reliable use of numerical methods often requires preliminary analysis using standard elementary techniques. <b></b> The first few sections of most chapters introduce the principle ideas of each topic, with remaining sections devoted to extensions and applications. Topics covered include first-order differential equations, linear equations of higher order, power series methods, Laplace transform methods, linear systems of differential equations, numerical methods, nonlinear systems and phenomena, Fourier series methods, and Eigenvalues and boundary value problems. <b></b> For those involved in the fields of science, engineering, and mathematics. </p></p><p>Focused on the standard elementary techniques of solution of differential equations and the mathematical modeling of real-world situations, this book anticipates and addresses the questions and difficulties typically encountered by those studying the subject for the first time.Maintaining a contemporary perspective, this strongly algebraic-oriented text provides a concrete and readable text for the traditional course in elementary differential equations that science, engineering, and mathematics readers take following calculus. Matters of definition, classification, and logical structure deserve (and receive here) careful attention for the first time in the mathematical experience of many of the readers. While it is neither feasible nor desirable to include proofs of the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems along the way in an elementary course, readers need to see precise and clear-cut statements of these theorems, and understand their role in the subject. Appropriate existence and uniqueness proofs in the Appendix are included, and referred to where appropriate in the main body of the text. Applications are highlighted throughout the text. These include: What explains the commonly observed lag time between indoor and outdoor daily temperature oscillations?; What makes the difference between doomsday and extinction in alligator populations?; How do a unicycle and a two-axle car react differently to road bumps?; Why are flagpoles hollow instead of solid?; Why might an earthquake demolish one building and leave standing the one next door?; How can you predict the time of next perihelion passage of a newly observed comet?; Why and when does non-linearity lead to chaos in biological and mechanical systems?; What explains the difference in the sounds of a guitar, a xylophone, and a drum? Includes almost 300 computer-generated graphics throughout the text. This text, with enough material for 2 terms, provides a concrete and readable text for the traditional course in elementary differential equations that science, engineering, and mathematics readers take following calculus.</p><h2>Time and Eternity: Exploring God&#39;s Relationship to Time</h2><p><p>This remarkable work offers an analytical exploration of the nature of divine eternity and God's relationship to time.</p></p><p><p><strong>William Lane Craig</strong> (PhD, University of Birmingham, England; DTheol, University of Munich) is research professor of philosophy at Talbot School of Theology in La Mirada, California, and at Houston Baptist University in Houston, Texas. He has authored or edited over thirty books and is the founder of ReasonableFaith.org, a web-based apologetics ministry.</p><p>Research Professor of Philosophy, Talbot School of Theology; Founder, Reasonable Faith, www.reasonablefaith.org</p><p><em>Time and Eternity</em> deals with difficult issues in modern physics and brings them into relation with traditional theological doctrines. Craig has done a great work, and it is marvelous that now the philosophy of religion is engaging with the philosophy of science to the great benefit of both.<br>--John R. Lucas<br>Fellow of Merton College, Oxford University</p><p><em>Time and Eternity</em> offers a comprehensive discussion of the problems in the concepts of time and eternity on the basis of an extraordinary familiarity with a vast number of recent contributions to this issue from scientists and philosophers. The argument is subtle and precise. Particularly important are the sections on the impact of the different versions of relativity theory on the concept of time.... The book offers a plausible argument for a realistic conception of temporal process and for God's involvement in the temporal distinctions and processes because of His presence in His creation.<br>--Wolfhart Pannenberg<br>Professor of Systematic Theology<br>Ludwig Maximilliens Universitaet-Muenchen, Germany</p><p>As a scientist doing theoretical research in gravitational physics and quantum cosmology, I found Dr. Craig's thoughtful book highly interesting. He has carefully given arguments defending several different viewpoints for each of the many issues about time that he discusses, followed by critiques in which he emphasizes his own opinion. Reading <em>Time and Eternity</em> has forced me to develop better arguments for my own opinions (which differ considerably from Craig's).... I am certain that <em>Time and Eternity</em> will also stimulate your thinking about this fascinating subject and your appreciation for the God who created time as part of the marvelous universe He has given us.<br>--Don N. Page<br>Professor of Physics and Fellow of the Cosmology and Gravitation Program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research<br>University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p><p>William Lane Craig is one the leading philosophers of religion and one of the leading philosophers of time. In this book, he combines his expertise in these areas to produce an original, erudite, and accessible theory of time and God that will be of great interest to both the general public and scholars. It is a rewarding experience to read through this brilliant and well-researched book by one of the most learned and creative thinkers of our era.<br>--Quentin Smith<br>Professor of Philosophy, Western Michigan University</p><p>In <em>Time and Eternity,</em> William Lane Craig defends the remarkable conclusion that "God is timeless without creation and temporal since creation." Craig argues his case philosophically by carefully weighing evidence for and against divine temporality and personhood in light of dynamic versus static theories of time and their warrants, in turn, in a Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity and an objective, mind-independent theory of becoming, including fascinating excursions into Big Bang cosmology and the philosophy of mathematics. As the latest in his series of ground-breaking books, <em>Time and Eternity</em> summarizes and extends Craig's previous technical arguments and conveys them to a more general audience. It is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in the problem of time and eternity in Christian philosophy.<br>--Robert Russell<br>Professor of Theology and Science<br>Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, Calif.</p><p>The nature of time is a continuing source of puzzlement both to science and in everyday life. It is also an important issue in theological understandings of the nature of God. In this interesting book, Professor Craig tackles this complex set of topics in a clear way. His discussion of the interrelated scientific, philosophical, and theological issues clears up many previous misconceptions and proposes a plausible understanding of the relation of God to time and eternity that many will find helpful.<br>--George Ellis<br>Professor of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics<br>University of Capetown</p></p><h2>The Dogs and the Wolves</h2><p>A wonderful, panoramic novel and an achingly poignant love story that goes back to Ir�ne N�mirovsky's roots, from the bestselling author of <b>Suite Fran�aise</b>.<br><br>Ada grows up motherless in the Jewish pogroms of a Ukrainian city in the early years of the twentieth century.

According to his usual habit, he dined at the \emph{Cr�merie des Quatre �v�ques}, read his newspaper, \emph{La Croix}, and at ten o&#39;clock went home to his little house in the Rue du Regard. The good man had no trouble and no presentiment of evil; his sleep was peaceful. The next morning at seven o&#39;clock to the minute, he entered the little room leading to the library, and, according to his daily habit, doffed his grand frock-coat, and taking down an old one which hung in a cupboard over his washstand, put it on. Then he went in to his workroom, where for sixteen years he had been cataloguing six days out of the seven, under the lofty gaze of Alexandre d&#39;Esparvieu. Preparing to make a round of the various rooms, he entered the first and largest, which contained works on theology and religion in huge cupboards whose cornices were adorned with bronze-coloured busts of poets and orators of ancient days. Two enormous globes representing the earth and the heavens filled the window-embrasures. But at his first step Monsieur Sariette stopped dead, stupefied, powerless alike to doubt or to credit what his eyes beheld. On the blue cloth cover of the writing-table books lay scattered about pell-mell, some lying flat, some standing upright. A number of quartos were heaped up in a tottering pile. Two Greek lexicons, one inside the other, formed a single being more monstrous in shape than the human couples of the divine Plato. A gilt-edged folio was all a-gape, showing three of its leaves disgracefully dog&#39;s-eared. Having, after an interval of some moments, recovered from his profound amazement, the librarian went up to the table and recognised in the confused mass his most valuable Hebrew, French, and Latin Bibles, a unique Talmud, Rabbinical treatises printed and in manuscript, Aramaic and Samaritan texts and scrolls from the synagogues---in fine, the most precious relics of Israel all lying in a disordered heap, gaping and crumpled. Monsieur Sariette found himself confronted with an inexplicable phenomenon; nevertheless he sought to account for it. - Taken from &#34;The Revolt Of The Angels&#34; written by Anatole France</p><p></p><h2>James Madison and the Creation of the American Republic (Library of American Biography Series) (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>In this biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jack Rakove examines the life and legacy of James Madison, one of the founding fathers of the United States. </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Paperback, brief, and inexpensive, each of the titles in the <i>Library of American Biography Series</i> focuses on a figure whose actions and ideas significantly influenced the course of American history and national life.

But the real roots of the enmity between the two nations mystify Washington policymakers, and no promising pathways to peace have emerged. This book traces the shifting relations among Israel, Iran, and the United States from 1948 to the present, uncovering for the first time the details of secret alliances, treacherous acts, and unsavory political maneuverings that have undermined Middle Eastern stability and disrupted U.S. foreign policy initiatives in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trita Parsi, a U.S. foreign policy expert with more than a decade of experience, is the only writer who has had access to senior American, Iranian, and Israeli decision makers. He dissects the complicated triangular relations of their countries, arguing that America&#x2019;s hope for stability in Iraq and for peace in Israel is futile without a correct understanding of the Israeli-Iranian rivalry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parsi&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes revelations about Middle East events will surprise even the most knowledgeable readers: Iran&#x2019;s prime minister asks Israel to assassinate Khomeini, Israel reaches out to Saddam Hussein after the Gulf War, the United&nbsp;States&nbsp;foils Iran&#x2019;s plan to withdraw support from Hamas and Hezbollah, and more. This book not only revises our understanding of the Middle East&#x2019;s recent past, it also spells out a course for the future. In today&#x2019;s belligerent world, few topics, if any, could be more important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Q: What is new about your book?</b></p><p>A: It&#x2019;s about how geopolitical struggles in the Middle East are fueling the tensions between Iran, Israel, and the United States, and how a failure to address the root causes of these struggles has made an already bad situation worse. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the book shows that Iran's and Israel&#x2019;s enmity is not about ideology even though both states find it useful to portray it as such. And it shows how even under the worst of circumstances, these two former allies Iran and Israel have kept communicating behind the scenes.</p><p><b>Q: What have been the main causes of the breakdown between Iran, Israel, and the United States?</b></p><p>A: The major transformations of Israeli-Iranian relations have all coincided with geopolitical and not ideological shifts in the region. The common threats Iran and Israel faced back in the 1980s the Soviet Union and Iraq pushed the two countries closer to each other, and Israel lobbied Washington to talk to Tehran. In the early 1990s, Iran and Israel&#x2019;s common foes were eliminated, and they suddenly found themselves facing each other in the process of establishing a new regional order. In this new geopolitical reality, Iran and Israel were no longer uneasy security partners, but fierce rivals.</p><p><b>Q: What in your view is the best path the U.S., Israel, and Iran can take to avoid a war?</b></p><p>A: The risk for such a conflict is significant as long as all three states look for maximalist goals. The underlying problem is that the Middle East lacks a sustainable order, one in which all states are given a stake in the region&#x2019;s security. Both Israel and Iran have been efficient spoilers, but neither has been able to implement&nbsp;its own vision of the Middle East. Only a <i>common</i> vision for the Middle East one based on collective security can tame the Israeli-Iranian rivalry.</p><p><b>Q: What unique qualifications do you bring to this study?</b></p><p>A: The book is based on my interviews with the top leadership in all three countries. The state of the triangular relationship between the U.S., Israel, and Iran has been extensively discussed in penetrating interviews that go well beyond the public talking points. As a result, the book reveals perspectives and strategic calculations that so far have been hidden from Western audiences.</p><p>Trita Parsi is president, National Iranian American Council, and adjunct professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University SAIS (School of Advanced International Studies).

In a prose that is ruthless as well as possessed of an enormous comic verve, the dedicated, the stupid, the rapacious, and the foolish are dissected. Eight major characters, many of whom reappear in Sorrentino&#x2019;s later novels, are employed to allow the reader a variety of views of the same world.<br><br>Told in the weary voice of a cynical and sardonic narrator, the novel is crammed with fantastic characters, incidents, and episodes, and moves from wit and satire through elegiac brooding, to bitter invective. It is a superb re-creation of a real time and place.</p><p>In addition to his books of poetry and criticism, Gilbert Sorrentino is the author of fourteen novels, including Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things, The Sky Changes, and Mulligan Stew. He has received numerous grants and awards throughout his career, including the John Dos Passos Prize for Literature, two Guggenheim Fellowships, two NEA Fellowships and a Lannan Literary Award."His purpose is creative, not destructive, even though his creation will destroy some myths and haze any number of people who care to find themselves embodied here. . . . Gilbert Sorrentino has kept a steady hand on this bucking book and neither reader nor character will take over. This is part of the book's refusal to submit to the age of take-over. . . . The novel is also a kind of destruction of fake, skim-surface symbolism. . . . The richness of this book is hard to describe." -- <i>Gregory Rabassa, The Nation 8-21-72</i><br><br>"Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things is a bitter, funny, and moving work of fiction about . . . the way life and art feed off one anotherand starve one another too. . . . The lives of these characters are realized with a remorseless energy that I find admirable." -- <i>Robert Scholes, Saturday Review 10-23-71</i><br><br>"The book has aged well: The world may look different now and new fashions may prevail but the phony, like the poor, will be with us always. . . . Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things has that air of astonished contempt that keeps true satire fresh forever." -- <i>Michael Heyward, Washington Post Book World 12-22-91</i><br><br>"There is a truculent intelligence behind it all, one given to outrage and joy. . . . Its power is unmistakable and its design ambitious, the right sort of antidote for the fakery, the foundation men, and the hangers-on in the literary world." -- <i>Paul Theroux, Washington Post Book World 11-7-71</i><br><br>"[T]he author's fury at it all is tempered . . . and augmented with compassion, understanding [and] wit." -- <i>Publishers Weekly 11-1-91</i></p><h2>Baseball for Dummies 3rd Edition</h2><p>"Joe Morgan again shows himself a rare bird: an ex-jock with savvy and the ability to communicate it."<br> <i>&#x2014;<b>People</b></i> <p>"This book has something for everybody, from longtime fans to Little Leaguers."<br> <i>&#x2014;<b>New York Newsday</b></i></p> <p><i>Baseball For Dummies, Third Edition,</i> is for baseball fans at all levels, from players and coaches to spectators who love the game.

With its chatty style, snappy graphics, and enjoyably informative top-10 lists, the book sticks to the Dummies format better than most pitchers follow their catchers' signs, a plus to be sure. The real plus, though, resides in the deftness of Joe Morgan's voice. The former Hall of Fame second baseman-turned television analyst has proven himself a natural communicator in the booth; he comes across just as comfortable, informative, and thorough in print. His enthusiasm spills over, but not at the expense of his broad knowledge. Morgan, naturally, covers the bases--hitting, pitching, fielding, running, coaching--with plenty of whys teamed up with the requisite how-tos. For added expertise he calls on fellow pros such as Hall of Famer Bob Gibson and MVP third-baseman Ken Caminiti.

She examines the relationship of camera images to the production of cultural memory, the mixing of fantasy and reenactment in memory, the role of trauma and survivors in creating cultural comfort, and how discourses of healing can smooth over the tensions of political events.<br><br>Sturken's discussion encompasses a brilliant comparison of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the AIDS Quilt; her profound reading of the Memorial as a national wailing wall&#x2015;one whose emphasis on the veterans and war dead has allowed the discourse of heroes, sacrifice, and honor to resurface at the same time that it is an implicit condemnation of war&#x2015;is particularly compelling. The book also includes discussions of the Kennedy assassination, the Persian Gulf War, the Challenger explosion, and the Rodney King beating. While debunking the image of the United States as a culture of amnesia, Sturken also shows how remembering itself is a form of forgetting, and how exclusion is a vital part of memory formation.</p><p>In <i>Tangled Memories</i>, Marita Sturken attempts to explain how events take on cultural meaning through what she calls "technologies of memory," primarily monuments, texts, icons and images. She argues memory has as much to do with fantasy and invention as with truth and that it attains a narrative form separate from history and possessed of its own political significance. Although it focuses primarily on the Vietnam War and the AIDS epidemic, her book also takes in the Kennedy assassination, the <i>Challenger</i> explosion, the beating of Rodney King, and the Gulf War. Sturken's conclusions are often belabored: that the American Vietnam memorial fails to capture the horrors brought upon the Vietnamese people is a rather unoriginal and obvious insight she blames on the "underlying nationalism of the Washington Mall." Does the AIDS quilt she documents likewise obscure the worldwide ravages of the disease when spread upon the Mall? The theoretical discussion of memory and representation often bogs down in the political positions the author assumes rather than defends. One of the pities of such difficult exposition is that a relatively superb chapter on the Gulf War is "forgotten,"a mere 22 pages of her 358-page book."A startlingly original and integrated work that considers the ways in which American culture narrates, remembers, and thereby reenacts traumatic events in order to found and refound itself as a national culture. It is a remarkable interdisciplinary study."&#x2015;Lisa Lowe, author of <i>Immigrant Acts</i><br><br>"<i>Tangled Memories</i> is first-rate: it is exhaustively researched, has an immense command of the literature, and brims with fascinating and original insights. It is a very important book."&#x2015;James E. Young, author of <i>The Texture of Memory</i><br><br>"This book makes a major contribution to our understanding of U.S. culture in the past two decades."&#x2015;John Carlos Rowe, coeditor of <i>The Vietnam War and American Culture</i></p><h2>Ophthalmology</h2><p><p>Long considered <b>one of ophthalmology's premier texts</b>, this award-winning title by Drs.

Unlike much Napoleonic literature that features the personality and foreign policy of the Emperor, it describes the condition of France and the French people during the fifteen years immediately following their great revolution. The translator, R. R. Palmer, is a distinguished historian who has written and translated many books in French history, including <i>The Coming of the French Revolution</i> by Georges Lefebvre (Princeton).</p><br><br><p>Applying the methods of the new social history (<i>Annales</i> school), the author covers the political, administrative, social, economic, and cultural facets of the First Empire. Part I deals with the domestic program and institutions under Napoleon and the fervor of the new chief of state as he sought to establish a coherent, efficient, and thoroughly controlled regime. Part II examines the opposition to his system and the reasons behind the imperfect realization of his ideal. It discusses population and demographic trends, social structure, and economic activity--all of which eluded Napoleon's grasp.</p></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)"Bergeron, a distinguished French historian with sympathies for the <i>Annales </i>school, has produced an excellent social history of France in the Napoleonic period.... Highly recommended." (<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>Music in Our World</h2><p><i>Music in Our World</i> is the first text in music appreciation completely devoted to the study of music elements and to investing students with active listening skills.<br><br> The text examines each musical element from a number of angles - completely integrating world music throughout the discussion. The three chapters on Melody, for example, cite the work of Hildegard of Bingen, Ravi Shankar, and Giacomo Puccini.<br><br> This unique, elements-based approach engages students in actively listening to the broadest range of music available for music appreciation.</p><p>Gary White holds a Ph.D. in Music Composition from Michigan State University. At his retirement in 1994 he was Distinguished Professor of Music at Iowa State University, where he developed and administered the music theory curriculum and established the electronic and computer music studio. For a number of years he was also in charge of music listening courses for the general student at Iowa State. Dr. White is the composer of over fifty published musical compositions and the author of Music First!

Part 2</h2><p><p>Continuing the paperback edition of Charles S.

This volume consists of the prose translation of Giorgio Petrocchi's Italian text (which faces the translation on each page); its companion volume of commentary is a masterpiece of erudition, offering a wide range of information on such subjects as Dante's vocabulary, his characters, and the historical sources of incidents in the poem. Professor Singleton provides a clear and profound analysis of the poem's basic allegory, and the illustrations, diagrams, and map clarify points that have previously confused readers of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>.</p></p><p>"With the publication of Singleton's edition of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, we have in English . . .

The books focus on geographical areas, language groups, important historical events, as well as village life and homes. Some of the books also explain the impact Europeans had on the lives of native peoples. Every step of the research, writing, and editing process has involved native writers and consultants and has been meticulously checked for cultural sensitivities -- and, of course, Bobbie Kalman has put her teaching expertise to work on each book.<p>This fascinating book looks at many of the lodges, or dwellings, built and used by the native nations across the continent. A map showing the lodges appears at the beginning of the book, and beautiful, detailed illustrations show the exteriors, interiors, and way of life in each lodge.

Dealing candidly with the basic human emotions of love and hate, his virile, personal tone exerts a powerful appeal on all kinds of readers. The 116 poems collected in this new translation include the famous Lesbia poems and display the full range of Catullus&#39;s mastery of lyric meter, mythological themes, and epigrammatic invective and wit.</p><p>Gaius Valerius Catullus (ca. 84 BC ca. 54 BC) was one of the most influential Roman poets of the 1st century BC.

Thankfully, seasoned East Asian correspondent Peter Harmsen has written an engrossing study that goes far to fill the gap in the historiography of a neglected theater of operations and the first large-scale urban battle of the war.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michigan War Studies Review<br><br>This deeply researched book describes one of the great forgotten battles of the 20th century. At its height it involved nearly a million Chinese and Japanese soldiers while sucking in three million civilians as unwilling spectators and victims. It turned what had been a Japanese adventure in China into a general war between the two oldest and proudest civilizations of the Far East. Ultimately, it led to Pearl Harbor and to seven decades of tumultuous history in Asia. The Battle of Shanghai was a pivotal event that helped define and shape the modern world.<br><br>Actors from a variety of nations were present in Shanghai during the three fateful autumn months when the battle raged. The rich cast included China's ascetic Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his Japanese adversary, General Matsui Iwane, who wanted Asia to rise from disunity, but ultimately pushed it toward its deadliest conflict ever. Claire Chennault, later of &#x201c;Flying Tiger&#x201d; fame, was among the figures emerging in the course of the campaign, as was First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In an ironic twist, Alexander von Falkenhausen, a stern German veteran of the Great War, abandoned his role as a mere advisor to the Chinese army and led it into battle against the Japanese invaders.<br><br>In its sheer scale, the struggle for China&#x2019;s largest city was a sinister forewarning of what was in store for the rest of mankind only a few years hence. It demonstrated how technology had given rise to new forms of warfare, or had made old forms even more lethal. Amphibious landings, tank assaults, aerial dogfights and most importantly, urban combat, all happened in Shanghai in 1937. It was a dress rehearsal for World War II&#x2014;or perhaps more correctly it was the inaugural act in the war&#x2014;the first major battle in the global conflict.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Acknowledgments<br>Prologue<br><br>1.

He is also the former bureau chief in Taiwan for French news agency AFP. His books have been translated into Chinese, Danish, and Romanian.&#x201c;...enhances the bare facts with material gleaned from multiple diaries, reports, newspaper and magazine articles, books, and other accounts from combatants and civilians of all nationalities. In addition to on-the-spot impressions from a surprising number of Chinese and Japanese foot soldiers, the book also features eyewitness reports from and about foreigners living and working in the cosmopolitan city at the time. As the author notes, the battle of Shanghai was front page news throughout much of the world, and numbers of journalists from around the globe covered the fighting from both sides of the line while crossing in and out of the safety and comfort of the international concessions. Besides using many contemporary documents as sources, Harmsen has chosen to illustrate the book with an especially noteworthy selection of very striking wartime photographs. ...engaging account of a little-known battle. ...practically nothing else in English tackles this topic at this level. .. (<i>Stone &amp; Stone Second World War Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;... rattles along like a modern techno-thriller and moves gracefully between descriptions of the tactical battlefield and the impact on the company, platoon or individual to the strategic machinations of the &#x201c;top brass&#x201d; and the movement of armies and divisions. Whilst the book piqued my interest in the pre Second World War Sino-Japanese conflict it stands very successfully as an excellent piece of military writing in its own right. One only has to be interested in warfare to appreciate this book.It is supported as is usual by a centre of black and white pictures showing Shanghai in the thirties and scenes from the conflict. ... Also there are a number of maps to allow you to follow the general course of the action.Overall this book is highly recommended. For wargamers it has got all the makings of an excellent campaign or demonstration game - naval gunnery support, tanks, direct tactical air support, two evenly matched forces, Marines, the what if scenario of conflict spreading into the International Settlement (other colonial powers had troops and naval forces in Shanghai), German military advisors and of course a cavalry charge! For military historians it is an interesting insight into the development of the tactical use of military technology in the lead up to the Second World War. And, finally, it is damn good read!&#x201d; (<i>Wargamer</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...has all the elements of a fabulous historical novel. ...Yet from another angle it is a historical minefield...he seamless way in which Harmsen weaves Chiang&#x2019;s international political maneuvering into battlefield strategy, combining the perspectives of regular privates and commanding generals, along with civilians and combatants, suggests his narrative was of long gestation...one of the really remarkable features of &#x201c;Shanghai 1937&#x201d; is the huge collection of high-quality photographs, all of them in-period and directly relevant to the action, in three 16-page inserts. Also, one cannot help noticing that many of them are credited to the &#x201c;author&#x2019;s collection.&#x201d;.. few who have read the book have failed to be gripped by the narrative.&#x201d; (<i>Taiwan Today</i>)<br><br>"What&#x2019;s special about this book is its comprehensiveness, shifting between Chinese, Japanese and foreign points of view to describe the causes of the battle, Chiang Kai-shek&#x2019;s strategy, the Chinese army&#x2019;s attack, the stalemate and the fall of Shanghai. The photos selected for the book also illustrate the operations on the two sides as well as the conditions endured by the people of Shanghai. .... In addition to accounts by participants on both the Chinese and Japanese side as well as contemporary newspaper reports, the book also uses the memoirs of numerous foreigners. In this respect it is richer than a lot of works in the Chinese language." (<i>Shenzhen Special Zone Daily</i>)<br><br>"All through the 1930s an extremely bloody war was fought in China. It was a war that involved great power interests, clashing ideologies and local interests. This entire complex and bloody jigsaw is the topic of China expert Peter Harmsen's book on the battle of Shanghai in 1937. There are not very many books on this topic and this period, which has been a neglected chapter in western history writing. Therefore, Peter Harmsen has written an important book. It&#x2019;s about events that happened more than 70 years ago, but it&#x2019;s relevant for the present age because the same great power interests are at work today... The book is extremely readable and deserves praise for telling the story of a forgotten aspect of the global showdown of the 1930s" (<i>Politiken</i>)<br><br>&#x201d;This is not traditional war history, but an extremely dramatic documentary thriller. It&#x2019;s based on facts, collected in meticulous and time-consuming fashion from diaries, newspaper articles, books and memoirs, but in contrast to much other war literature, you get so close to the actors, from generals to Chinese and Japanese privates and civilians, that as a reader you have to constantly remind yourself that this was real, involved a million soldiers, and was to lead to the global changes of the next ten years... Peter Harmsen has written a book that has many qualities and extremely high information and entertainment value. It&#x2019;s about time that we reach a better understanding of the causes of World War Two, a chain of events where the battle of Shanghai had a much bigger impact than military historians in the west have realized so far. Shanghai 1937... is not only an invaluable piece of military history, but also a book with formidable powers of empathy that at times make the reader feel like an actual participant in the bloody events.&#x201d; (<i>Jyllands-Posten</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;...an arrow straight account of the pyrrhic battle for much of the city....challenges the notion that the Second World War began in 1939 and he has a point. I am pleased to have read it....If you are looking to expand your world knowledge to the Middle Kingdom, have a look at this book. If the advance of the Japanese interests you it might make a nice change not to read about endless embarrassing retreats of colonial armies for a while.&#x201d; (<i>War in History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The author has processed a huge number of original Chinese and Japanese sources, interviewed survivors and collected an impressive number of photos and a large array of useful maps. This gives the narrative substance and credibility. At the same time, it&#x2019;s also a very objective and nuanced account... With his book, Peter Harmsen fills a huge historiographical void. The story is told in a highly riveting manner. Shanghai 1937: Stalingrad on the Yangtze is almost impossible to put aside once you have started, and even harder to put aside after you have finished the last page.&#x201d; (<i>Weekendavisen</i>)<br><br>"One of the most sobering things about reading history is realizing the ease with which the deaths of a millions can be forgotten in only a few decades. I am currently reading Shanghai 1937: Stalingrad on the Yangtze, by Peter Harmsen. I recommend it heartily. Even if you thought you knew all there was to know about the Second World War, if you haven&#x2019;t read up on the Sino-Japanese conflict, you&#x2019;ve missed one of its principal roots... The Japanese were in real danger of losing the Battle of Shanghai, in part because the Chinese Army was advised by German officers, some of whom were Jewish and fleeing from Hitler." (<i>The Belmont Club</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There is no doubt that one of the most important historical accounts of the year is Peter Harmsen&#x2019;s book about the war between China and Japan. It&#x2019;s an original and thorough work which turns the prevailing consensus of the past generations upside down and questions what many historians have so far taken for granted... It&#x2019;s impossible not to become more knowledgeable from reading Harmsen&#x2019;s book... The complicated strategic material is reinforced with contemporary testimony and anecdotes throughout.&#x201d; (<i>Kristeligt Dagblad</i>)</p><h2>Power System Analysis and Design (with CD-ROM)</h2><p>The new edition of Glover and Sarma&#39;s highly-respected text provides students with an introduction to the basic concepts of power systems along with tools to aid them in applying these skills to real world situations. Like earlier editions of the book, physical concepts are highlighted while also giving necessary attention to math-ematical techniques. Both theory and modeling are developed from simple beginnings so that they can be readily extended to new and complex situations. Beginning in Ch. 3, students are introduced to new concepts critical to analyzing power systems, including coverage of both balanced and unbalanced operating conditions. The authors incorporate new tools and material to aid students with design issues and reflect recent trends in the field. Each book now contains a CD with Power World software. This package is commonly used in industry and will enable students to analyze and simulate power systems. The authors use the software to extend, rather than replace, the fully worked examples provided in previous editions. In the new edition, each Power World Simulator example includes a fully worked hand solution of the problem along with a Power World Simulator case (except when the problem size makes it impractical). The new edition also contains updated case studies on recent trends in the Power Systems field, including coverage of deregulation, increased power demand, economics, and alternative sources of energy. These case studies are derived from real life situations.</p><p>A Ph.D. from MIT, J. Duncan Glover is President and Principal Engineer at Failure Electrical, LLC.

Unique in its focus on just the seventeenth century, this title moves through the century chronologically and discusses key works in great depth.</p><p><p> This important new introduction to the major developments in art and architecture that emerged from seventeenth-century Western Europe bridges the gap between the specialized study and a more general survey. <i>Seventeenth-Century Art and Architecture</i> encompasses the socio-political and cultural background of the period. In the process it examines the careers of the most significant painters, sculptors, and architects, and those of less well-known artists. </p> <p> Italy is the logical place to begin this geographical tour of Europe, not least because it was a magnet for Flemish and French artists, and because Italian artists were highly prized by the Spanish, French, and English courts. In Bologna and Rome, Annibale Carracci and Caravaggio embarked upon a stylistic revolution that deposed the international Mannerist style. The Counter-Reformation Church in Rome offered so many opportunities for artists that the city secured its position as the most vital European artistic center. </p> <p> Subsequent chapters focus on Flanders, Spain, France, the Dutch Republic, and England. The increasing influence of secular patronage is reflected in the popularity of mythological and biblical themes with obvious erotic content. Commissions that had hitherto been the exclusive privilege of the Church, monarchy, aristocrats, and major guilds now originated from upper middle-class patrons seeking portraits of themselves and their families, landscapes of their own terrain, genre scenes for their entertainment, and still-lifes reflecting their sophisticated tastes. </p> <p> Major artists covered include Bernini, Borromini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Claude, Girardon, Guercino, Hals, Jones, Le Brun, Le Van, Murillo, Poussin, Rembrandt, Reni, Ribera, Rubens, Ruisdael, Steen, Van Dyck, Velazquez, Vermeer, Wren, and Zurbaran. The seventeenth century also witnessed the emergence of successful women painters such as Artemisia Gentileschi and Clara Peeters, who receive due attention here. </p> <p> Covering artistic developments across six countries and examining in detail many of the artworks on display, this book demonstrates considerable breadth and depth. Reflecting the latest developments in research, it is more substantial and up-to-date than any comparable survey. Written with great clarity, knowledge, and affection, it is a true tribute to its subject. </p><p> <b><i>Ann Sutherland Harris</i></b> is Professor of the History of Art and Architecture at the University of Pittsburgh.

The book's focus on the inner logic of parliamentary government explains the rationale for Canada's relatively complex political system, which the authors encourage readers to think of as an organic entity, where change in one area inevitably ripples through the rest of the system.</p><br><p>The new edition includes the results of Canada&#x2019;s 2015 federal election and looks ahead to consider changes resulting from the Liberal victory. It has been thoroughly updated and revised and introduces several new topics, such as the impact of the previous Conservative government on the conventions and practices of parliamentary government and the important influence of social media on politics.

Another such book is the 1896 edition of Pope's <i>The Rape of the Lock</i>, illustrated by Aubrey Beardsley.<br>Beardsley's elaborate drawings for <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> were created during the last phase of his brief career. This nearly Romantic period, characterized by rich, brilliantly imagined decoration and ornamentation and by high textual contrasts, was perfectly suited to the blend of mock-heroic, satire, and delicate fancy of Pope's poems. As Beardsley's biographer R. A. Walker wrote, "These drawings show a verve, a wit and appreciation of the poem than can scarcely be matched in English literature." Using his unique line and "black blot" technique, Beardsley created a masterpiece of design and mood.<br>This Dover edition reproduces the first edition: the complete text of the five-canto poem, notes, seven full-page drawings, two half-page drawings, and the original cover design by Beardsley.</p></p><p>Alexander Pope (1688�1744) is widely regarded as the greatest English poet of the early&nbsp;18th century, best known for his satirical verse.

In the Middle Ages theological issues ranked foremost. In recent times astronomy and the physical sciences have taken over. Yet every attempt to grasp the true nature of the universe creates a new mask. In every age people have pitied the universes of their ancestors, believing that they have at last discovered the full truth. Do we now stand at the threshold of knowing everything, or have we created yet another mask, doomed to fade like all the rest?Edward Harrison is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Massachusetts, and adjunct Professor of Astronomy at the Steward Observatory, University of Arizona.</p><h2>The City Reader (Routledge Urban Reader Series)</h2><p><p>The fourth edition of the highly successful <em>The City Reader</em> brings together the very best of publications on the city.

Classics like the Kansas-Nebraska speech, the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, and the Gettysburg Address, along with less familiar writings &#x2014; poignant letters to individual voters, notes to generals on military strategy, and stirring public speeches &#x2014; show the development of Lincoln's thought on free labor, slavery, secession, the Civil War, and emancipation. Johnson provides historical context by weaving an engaging narrative around Lincoln&#x2019;s own words, making this volume the most accessible collection of Lincoln&#x2019;s writings available. Also included are 14 illustrations, relevant Civil War maps, a Lincoln chronology, reading questions, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p><b>Michael P.

Johnson (history, Johns Hopkins), the author of numerous historical studies and texts, including Reading the American Past: Selected Historical Documents, uses Lincoln's own utterances to shed light on the thought of this intriguing public figure and to tell the story of this highly significant conflict.

While the colonial French and English were locked in heated competition for the most native allies, the Indians sought to preserve their own independence, alighning themselves only when necessary with the colonial group that offered the best material and spiritual wares. Here, ethnohistorian James Axtell takes a fresh look at this contest of cultures to reveal why and how the French and Indians were able to rise so effectively to the challenge posed by English imperial design. Although the English offered better trade goods, they were ultimately defeated by their own stubborn need to impose their way of life on the reluctant native Americans. The French Jesuits, on the other hand, managed to keep the English at bay for a century and a half by adapting themselves to native life and so converting thousands of Indians to Catholicism. this is the first of three volumes in James Axtell&#39;s new series, THE CULTURAL ORIGINS OF NORTH AMERICA. The series is designed to provide an overview of the realtions between the three separate cultures that together formed America&#39;s roots, and offers a new perspective on America&#39;s colonial past.</p><p>James Axtell is at College of William and Mary."The best introduction now available to the problem of cultural conversion in the New World."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Offers an impressive array of insights."--The Historian<br><br>"Axtell is one of the finest practitioners of this history of real persons, and his style makes him one of its most graceful writers."--The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography<br><br>"The most ambitious and sophisticated contribution to early American ethnohistory to date."--Alden T.

Part of the Rethinking the Western Tradition series, this edition of the <i>Manifesto</i> features an extensive introduction by Jeffrey C. Isaac, and essays by Vladimir Tismaneanu, Steven Lukes, Saskia Sassen, and Stephen Eric Bronner, each well known for their writing on questions central to the <i>Manifesto</i> and the history of Marxism. These essays address the <i>Manifesto</i>'s historical background, its impact on the development of twentieth-century Communism, its strengths and weaknesses as a form of ethical critique, and its relevance in the post-1989, post-Cold War world. This edition also includes much ancillary material, including the many Prefaces published in the lifetimes of Marx and Engels, and Engels's "Principles of Communism."</p></p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>African Hairstyles: Styles of Yesterday and Today</h2><p>Shows traditional hairstyles used in each region of Africa and modern styles which make use of cornrowing and threading</p><p></p><h2>Statistical Techniques in Business and Economics (Mcgraw-hill/Irwin Series Operations and Decision Sciences)</h2><p>Lind/Marchal/Wathen is a perennial market best seller due to its comprehensive coverage of statistical concepts and methods delivered in a student friendly, step-by-step format.

He's backpacked through the mountains of the western United States and Alaska, received extensive training from law-enforcement and U.S. special operations personnel, and once woke up for a 2 A.M. watch aboard a sailboat only to discover that it was headed the wrong way through the Atlantic sea-lanes in heavy weather, with one of the crew suffering from hypothermia. In addition to being an avid sailor, David is also a certified scuba rescue diver and a former ski instructor. <i>Warning Light</i> is his first novel.<b>One</b><br><br> "Speedbird 337, maintain heading one-one-five. Contact Tehran Defense Radar on 127.8. Good day."<br><br> Inside the cockpit, First Officer Edward Blake responded to the Turkish air traffic controller.<br><br> "Roger that, Ankara Center. Speedbird 337 maintain heading one-one-five. Switching to 127.8."<br><br> He glanced to his left and caught Captain Sam Allard's eyes for a moment before turning the VHF radio to the new frequency. The British Airways flight, radio call sign "Speedbird," was closing in on Iran's Flight Information Region and needed permission to enter Iranian airspace.<br><br> "Tehran Radar, this is Speedbird 337 heavy."<br><br> "Go ahead, Speedbird 337."<br><br> "Tehran Radar, Speedbird 337 with you at flight level three-niner-zero, estimate crossing your FIR at 15:20 hours."<br><br> "Roger, Speedbird 337, squawk 0413 and proceed as filed."<br><br> The radio fell silent while the Iranian controller verified the radar contact and flight plan that the British Airways pilots had filed before taking off from London.<br><br> In peaceful times, the flight would have followed the great circle route through Uzbekistan and Afghanistan before heading south below the Himalayas on its way to Singapore. For the past decade, however, hostilities in the area led most airlines to divert their jets to the south, over Iran. The detour added a few minutes and several thousand dollars to the cost of each flight, but it was safer than flying through a war zone.<br><br> "Speedbird 337, identified, cleared for entry. Contact Tehran Center on 133.4. Good day."<br><br> "Roger that, Radar, Speedbird 337 cleared for entry, switching to 133.4."<br><br> Captain Allard adjusted the autopilot and the six-hundred-twenty-ton Airbus A380 banked gently to the right before settling onto its new course. He scanned his instruments and cross-checked his flight computer. Underneath the wings of the Airbus, four Rolls-Royce Trent 970 engines were running smoothly, each delivering over eighty thousand pounds of thrust. The radio in the cockpit chirped sporadically as air traffic controllers directed the other planes in Sector Two around Tehran. Most of the flights were domestic, but Emirates, Air India, and other international carriers were not uncommon.<br><br> The long-haul flight was on schedule as Allard gazed out the cockpit windows. The late-day sun was starting to form shadows behind the mountains below. It was his first flight over Iran. It was more rugged and beautiful than he'd expected, but his reverie was interrupted by the copilot.<br><br> "Captain, we have a warning light on the number-three engine . . . Exhaust gas temperature is spiking and oil pressure is dropping quickly."<br><br> An automated voice in the cockpit called out another warning and a message flashed on the centralized aircraft monitor inside the cockpit. Captain Allard silenced the alarms. He was already looking at the engine data on his own monitors.<br><br> "I don't think we're going to be able to keep it running. Give me maximum continuous thrust on the good engines and let's run the engine shutdown checklist."<br><br> Blake made eye contact with his senior officer and took a deep breath. "Yes, sir, commencing in-flight shutdown on the number-three engine."<br><br> Blake pushed the button for the Fasten Seat Belt sign while Captain Allard switched to the air traffic control frequency on his headset.<br><br> "Tehran Center, Speedbird 337 requesting immediate clearance to flight level two-seven-zero. Our number-three engine has lost oil pressure and we're shutting it down."<br><br> The radio was quiet for a few long seconds. Allard and Blake shut down the malfunctioning engine and trimmed the aircraft's rudder to compensate for the off-center thrust.<br><br> "Speedbird 337, you are cleared to flight level two-seven-zero, understand number-three engine out. Are you declaring an emergency at this time?" asked the controller.<br><br> Allard looked at his copilot. "Take her down to two-seven-zero as soon as we hit driftdown speed."<br><br> "Center, 337 leaving flight level three-niner-zero for two-seven-zero. That's negative, repeat, negative on the emergency. We don't know the cause of the pressure loss yet but the other three engines are running smoothly."<br><br> "Roger, Speedbird 337. Confirm you are an A380?"<br><br> "That's affirmative, Center."<br><br> "Speedbird 337, nearest capable alternate airport is Esfahan, approximately sixty miles northwest of your position. Would you like vectors to the alternate?"<br><br> "Center, 337, negative on the alternate. We are proceeding on course, descending through flight level three-six-zero. We're going to look at restarting our number three once we reach engine-out altitude."<br><br> "Understood, Speedbird 337. Maintain heading one-two-five degrees, flight level two-seven-zero, and keep us advised of your status."<br><br> "Maintain heading one-two-five, Speedbird 337," confirmed Allard.<br><br> When the aircraft started its descent, most of the passengers felt a touch of weightlessness before their seat belts pulled them down. Flight attendants walked down the pitched aisles, waking the sleeping passengers and enforcing the seat-belt rule. Questions from the passengers were politely deflected despite the clearly elevated vigilance on the part of the crew.<br><br> Captain Allard picked up the handset for the internal public address system as the aircraft descended.<br><br> "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. You may have noticed that we've slowed down and descended over the past few minutes. Everything is fine. We'll soon be leveling off at twenty-seven thousand feet where we're going to stay for a bit. One of our engines was acting up so we decided to shut it down until we can correct the problem and get it restarted. The A380 is designed to fly quite well with only three engines and can get by with two if necessary. In the meantime, please listen to your flight attendants and remain in your seats. We will keep you apprised of the situation. Thank you."<br><br> The pilots spent a few minutes preparing to restart the idle engine but the warning lights flashed again. The mood in the cockpit remained businesslike despite the mounting problems.<br><br> Blake spoke calmly. "We've just lost Yellow hydraulic pressure."<br><br> The forces involved in moving the control surfaces on such a large aircraft were enormous. Without hydraulics to move the rudder, ailerons, and elevator, the pilots would be unable to maneuver the plane. The hydraulic systems were so critical that the A380 had two systems, Green and Yellow, to prevent a single failure from turning into a catastrophe.<br><br> "OK. What's Green system pressure and quantity?"<br><br> Blake was already looking at his monitor.<br><br> "Green is at 96 percent." He paused for a moment. "Make that 94 percent. Quantity is definitely falling. We may have a leak."<br><br> The pilots ran through a checklist to locate the cause of the problem. Years earlier, a Qantas Airways A380 had suffered a hydraulic failure after an engine exploded just after takeoff. The explosion had also been preceded by an oil-pressure loss. Only the skill of the crew, and much good luck, had allowed the aircraft to land safely.<br><br> The air traffic controller had just finished handling a domestic Iran Air flight when Blake switched his radio back to the air traffic control frequency.<br><br> "Tehran Center, Speedbird 337 . . ."<br><br> "Speedbird 337, this is Tehran Center, what is your status?"<br><br> "Center, our number three is still out, we've lost primary hydraulic pressure and are running on our secondary systems. Requesting vectors to the nearest capable alternate."<br><br> "Stand by, 337," ordered the controller before the radio went quiet.<br><br> A minute later, the controller returned. "Speedbird 337, turn left heading three-one-zero and descend and maintain flight level one-eight-zero. Prepare for landing at Beheshti International."<br><br> Allard and Blake looked at each other. The captain smiled, then shook his head.<br><br> Blake keyed his microphone and calmly said, "Center, Speedbird 337. Unable to comply."<br><br> "Speedbird 337, this is Tehran Center . . . Please say again."<br><br> The radio was quiet.<br><br> "Speedbird 337, this is Tehran Center. Please acknowledge."<br><br> There was silence from the cockpit.<br><br><b>Two</b><br><br> Area Control Center, Sector Two, was a cold, modern room dominated by computer monitors and communications equipment. The radio frequency handling Flight 337 was being broadcast over the loudspeakers and all eyes were on the air traffic controller working the flight. The veteran controller had worked planes with communications trouble, aircraft that had strayed off course, and even emergencies, but no one had ever disobeyed an instruction before. He looked over his shoulder for guidance from the sector chief.<br><br> "Why won't he divert to Beheshti?" shouted the chief.<br><br> The controller turned back to his monitor. Radar showed the British Airways flight continuing on course.<br><br> "They seem to be losing altitude and their course is oscillating."<br><br> "If they are going to avoid the restricted airspace they must divert now. Raise them again," the chief ordered.<br><br> "Speedbird 337, this is Tehran Center. Come in."<br><br> For reasons of national security, safety, or even recreation, most countries have restricted airspace. Some parts of the sky are simply off-limits to aircraft that don't have permission to be there, and the airspace in front of the struggling Airbus was most definitely off-limits.<br><br> "Speedbird 337, this is Tehran Center. Do you copy?"<br><br> The chief became angrier as the seconds passed in silence. "I am willing to believe we have an aircraft in distress if they communicate and divert, but they cannot simply ignore us. We have to assume a possible Trojan horse. Alert Western Area Command. Tell them we have an unresponsive aircraft and an imminent violation of the airspace around Sirjan."<br><br> The turbulent politics of the Middle East had led Iran to put military officers or reservists in control of its civilian air traffic control centers, and the Trojan horse scenario was one that all of their air defense specialists had studied. With air traffic control radar unable to distinguish an A380 on a routine passenger flight from a B-52 bomber intent on attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, controllers could only establish an aircraft's bona fides by assessing the pilot's communication, behavior, and pre-filed flight plan, all of which could be faked. This plane was already in central Iran and headed toward prohibited airspace, which was even more sensitive than restricted airspace. But the Iranians were ready.<br><br> With wars to its west and north, and unfriendly aircraft regularly patrolling the Persian Gulf to its south, Iran had fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles stationed throughout much of the country.<br><br> A technician in the air traffic control center picked up the third of several red phones on a console and spoke rapidly to the air force officer on the other end.<br><br> "Western Command, we have a foreign aircraft headed toward the Sirjan prohibited area, possible Trojan horse. Aircraft is one hundred and twenty nautical miles southeast of Esfahan, heading one-three-zero, twenty-five thousand feet . . . Aircraft has ignored instructions and is not answering its radio . . ." The technician listened for a minute. "I understand. One moment."<br><br> He held the phone at his side and pointed at the map on the computer screen in front of him as he spoke to the chief of center.<br><br> "In a few minutes they will exit the SAM net around Esfahan. If they continue on this course they won't be within range of the S-200 battery at Bandar Abbas or the HAWK battery in Sirjan for another twenty-five minutes. They're flying through a hole in our defensive net. They'll be in Southern Sector before Western can scramble fighters or launch a missile."<br><br> The chief scowled. "Raise Southern Area Command right now. Do we have any interceptors in Kerman?"<br><br> The technician spoke into another of the red phones and relayed his conversation to the chief.<br><br> "Kerman is still not operational because of the earthquake. Southern can scramble two F-14s from Shiraz in ten minutes, but their radar is down. They're asking us what to do."<br><br> The chief studied the digital map on the screen of the controller in front of him. With his finger on the screen, he traced the probable course of the violator.<br><br> "Tell them to launch the fighters and alert the SAM battery in Sirjan. We'll coordinate from here."<br><br> The technician relayed the orders and hung up the handset. He was a patriotic man, but he knew that the aircraft in question was almost certainly a civilian airliner with engine troubles. Shooting it down would kill the hundreds of passengers aboard. He stared at the computer monitor in front of him, willing the giant Airbus to turn around.<br><br> The very real threat of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities ensured that its interceptors were kept on a high state of alert. The fighters based in Shiraz were American-made F-14As that had been sold to Iran before the 1979 revolution. Despite its age, the F-14 was still a formidable air superiority fighter, and it would make quick work of a commercial airliner. Each of the two fighters carried a pilot and a weapons officer. In the thirty-second briefing they were given before they jogged to the flight line, the four aviators were told only that a foreign aircraft had disobeyed instructions, ceased communications with air traffic control, and was flying into prohibited airspace. No mention was made that there might be passengers aboard or equipment troubles. The fighters were to intercept the aircraft and await further orders. Typically they would force the jet to land at an airfield away from the forbidden airspace, but the fighters carried live weapons and the pilots were well trained. They would follow the orders they were given.<br><br> At the Seventh Tactical Airbase outside Shiraz, the lead fighter throttled up and lit its afterburners, sending cones of flame erupting from the engines as it rocketed into the afternoon sky. When the second fighter was airborne and formed up with his lead, the pair banked hard left and turned to their intercept course. The planes' variable aspect wings swept back to their high-speed positions and the fighters accelerated rapidly to just under Mach 1.5. They would cover the one hundred twenty-five miles to the Airbus in less than ten minutes. The big jet would be in missile range in less than five.<br><br> While the chief and the technician coordinated the intercept of the troubled airliner, the original controller tried repeatedly to raise the British Airways flight. In addition to the established VHF radio frequency, he broadcasted over the 121.5 MHz emergency-use frequency, which all aircraft monitored. The Airbus was nonresponsive.<br><br> The controller addressed the chief again.<br><br> "Sir, the target aircraft is ninety miles from Sirjan but has slowed and lost altitude. Airspeed is down to two hundred twenty knots and altitude is erratic around flight level two-forty. Their troubles may be worsening."<br><br> "Then why are they not descending and diverting to Esfahan as ordered? They are strictly forbidden to enter this area."<br><br> The technician was on the phone again. "Sir, the fighters are fifty miles out and have the target on radar. Southern Command is not going to let that aircraft reach Sirjan."<br><br> The chief hesitated. Every muscle in his face was strained.</p><h2>Limited Liability Companies For Dummies</h2><p><b>Become a savvy entrepreneur with your own LLC</b> <p><i>Limited Liability Companies For Dummies, 3rd Edition</i> offers a clear, concise guide that explains the pros and cons of LLCs, and shares insider tips on everything from choosing your members and your company name to creating and filing your Articles of Organization and managing day-to-day operations.

Simpler. These were our goals. We knew that to reflect modern macroeconomics we had to cover the Solow Model and the economics of ideas, Real Business Cycles, and New Keynesian economics. While most texts now cover the rudiments of economic growth, the importance of ideas is rarely even mentioned. Similarly, other texts do not offer a balanced treatment of Real Business Cycle theory and New Keynesian theory, instead favoring one theory and relegating the other to a few pages that are poorly integrated with the overall macro model. &nbsp;We also knew that our efforts to reflect modern macroeconomics would be wasted if we reached only a small percentage of the students. We had to make the material simpler, more compelling, and more intuitive.&nbsp;By boiling the Solow model down to its essence and by providing multiple paths through the material, we have made it accessible to all principles students. Our modern approach to business fluctuations is also simpler and yet more advanced at the same time. It is simpler because we model business fluctuations as fluctuations in the growth rate of output, rather than in the level of output. That creates a natural progression from growth theory to business fluctuations. It is simpler because we develop our balanced approach to Real Business Cycles and New Keynesian economics within a single, unified dynamic AD-AS model. And no other textbook offers the same depth of analysis of monetary and fiscal policy in response to both real and nominal shocks.&nbsp;That's why we call our text <i>Modern Principles: Macroeconomics</i>. We have taken recent advances in how economists think and describe macroeconomics and we have integrated them throughout the text. Growth theory is given full treatment and it is integrated with our dynamic macroeconomic model. Insights from Real Business Cycle theory and New Keynesian theory appear early in the text, not tacked on at the end as an afterthought. We are certain you will see that this text provides the best coverage of the new principles that macroeconomists use today.<br>&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>Changing How the World Does Business: FedEx&#39;s Incredible Journey to Success # The Inside Story</h2><p>From humble beginnings, FedEx has literally revolutionized the way business is conducted. Not too long ago, overnight shipping was barely an option for even the largest companies. Today, thanks to FedEx, it&#x2019;s available to every living room start-up. With annual revenues of $30 billion, more than 250,000 employees, 600 aircraft, and 70,000 surface vehicles, FedEx handles nearly six million shipments a day in two hundred countries. FedEx has become a household name, and has been named one of the top ten of America&#x2019;s Most Admired Companies by <i>Fortune</i> magazine.<br><br> But it wasn&#x2019;t always easy. From his inside vantage point as the company&#x2019;s first general manager and chief operating officer, Roger Frock reveals the remarkable details of how Fred Smith and his team endured their tumultuous early years&#x2014;fraught with a seemingly unending series of legal, financial, and operational crises that continually threatened the company&#x2019;s ability to stay in business&#x2014;and, in the end, created an entirely new industry.<br><br> Frock chronicles the dramatic last-minute saves and turnarounds the company engineered from its inception to the present. He entertains with stories of the trials and tribulations of the company&#x2019;s early struggles and victories&#x2014;from Pilots using personal credit cards to fuel planes, to the courier who hocked his watch to put gas in his delivery van, and, one of the most memorable episodes, the time that founder Fred Smith literally gambled the company&#x2019;s last remaining funds to keep the planes flying.<br><br> Frock&#x2019;s story introduces all the players&#x2014;FedEx&#x2019;s resourceful and resilient leaders and employees&#x2014;and shows how these remarkable individuals gave Fred Smith&#x2019;s original concept wings and, through flexibility, creativity, and commitment, made a fledgling startup into one of the great success stories in modern business. <i>Changing the Way the World Does Business</i> is an inspirational tale for leaders and entrepreneurs everywhere.</p><p>Roger Frock is president of Quest Management, Inc., a consulting firm that specializes in supply chain management. He has been a guest speaker at the National Council of Physical Distribution Management (now the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals), the American Management Association, and the American Trucking Association, and has made frequent presentations to other industry associations and private business groups on a variety of subjects.A Case History of Courage and Tenacity<br><br> 1<br><br> FedEx has changed the way we do business, allowing established firms to expand their services throughout the world and helping smaller companies to look and act like corporate giants, making overnight connections with global markets. Its founders helped to restructure the transportation industry and created a unique corporate culture that has placed FedEx among the most successful new ventures of the past 50 years.<br><br> Fortune magazine has described FedEx as one of the top ten business triumphs of the 1970s and lists the firm as one of the Top 10 Most Admired Companies in America and the world; one of 100 Best Companies to Work For in America, among which it has been listed continuously since 1998; and one of the 50 Best Companies for Minorities.<br><br> The company has also received similar accolades and recognition from the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Computerworld, Wired, Logistics Management and Distribution, Information Week, Business Ethics, Forbes, Air Cargo World, and Financial Times. Internationally, FedEx has been recognized as one of the best employers in Canada, Switzerland, Brazil, Latin America, Mexico, Chile, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, the Philippines, India, and Argentina.<br><br> In its original incarnation as Federal Express, the firm developed a completely new concept of customer service, pioneered technical advances for the entire transportation industry, and significantly altered our work environment. People can now live and work outside major metropolitan cities by utilizing FedEx&#x2019;s exceptional reach and reliability to connect with other areas of the business world. We can now move radiopharmaceuticals with short shelf lives and critical blood samples overnight and ship products directly from manufacturer to consumer, greatly simplifying the distribution chain.<br><br> 2<br><br> While FedEx is now a household word, the company that invented overnight delivery was far from an overnight success. The inside story is one of great interest to anyone starting a new business, for it highlights the extraordinary combination of grit and determination, teamwork and creative thinking, luck and perseverance needed to keep a company afloat in its early stages.<br><br> I had the good fortune to be a member of the initial team assembled by Fred Smith, the founder of Federal Express. We experienced difficulties and near disasters, but we also had our share of good fortune and occasional help from some surprising sources. On several occasions, we came within an inch of failure, because of dwindling financial resources, regulatory roadblocks, or unforeseen events like the Arab oil embargo. Once, Fred&#x2019;s luck at the gaming tables of Las Vegas helped to save the company from financial disaster. Another time, we had to ask our employees to hold their paychecks while we waited for the next wave of financing.<br><br> Fred&#x2019;s tenacious drive and brilliant leadership got us through crisis after crisis. However, no individual can create and build a successful enterprise without the help of others. This book contains the personal insights of the people who took part in the FedEx startup&#x2014;many appear for the first time in print. This is the insider&#x2019;s view, full of cliffhangers and last-minute saves that show the trials faced by anyone launching a new business.<br><br> The FedEx story shows the careful planning required for a startup and the flexibility and quick thinking needed to deal with unanticipated challenges. Knowledgeable professionals evaluated the Federal Express concept, researched the potential market for the service, investigated the competition, and prepared a startup plan. However, the concept went through several critical adjustments on its roller-coaster ride to success. In this book, I set out to explore the process of innovation and the character traits needed to move a promising vision into the real world.<br><br> 3<br><br> FedEx went through several periods of risk and turmoil, yet breakthroughs often followed our periods of deep apprehension and doubt. Our final lesson is a positive one: If the concept is right, courage and tenacity can tilt the odds in one&#x2019;s favor.<br><br> The FedEx story is also an antidote to the negative press big business has received in the past few years. We read every day about the greed, the lies, and the fraudulent practices in both the private and public sector. The founders of FedEx were not perfect, but their basic operating principles of integrity, truth, equality, and personal responsibility provide a model for others to emulate. In a rapidly changing business climate, we valued open communications and cooperation at every level of the organization. FedEx created a win-win climate for all of its constituents, providing security for its employees, reliable service for its customers, and a fair return to its shareholders.<br><br> After the Enron and WorldCom scandals, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its requirement that chief executive officers attest to the correctness of their financial reports. FedEx was one of the first major corporations to do so, without requesting extra time for review, because its CEO had created an ethical climate and remained closely involved with the company&#x2019;s day-today operations.<br><br> It is my fondest hope that this book will serve as a principled guide for new startups as well as established companies, and perhaps even convince a few of the ethically challenged to reexamine their options. It is possible for an organization to operate with ethical principles and still be successful.<br><br> The front-row seat to FedEx&#x2019;s incredible journey to success that this book offers will appeal to a wide and diverse audience. In addition to those launching new enterprises, business analysts will profit from this firsthand account of the company&#x2019;s growth from startup to maturity. Executives desiring to improve their leadership skills can learn from the strategy and tactics employed by Fred Smith and his leadership team. Finally, managers and supervisors can learn how to motivate employees and encourage innovative thinking.<br><br> For convenience, the book is organized chronologically.<br><br> PART I examines the development of the concept, with the initial goal of transporting small time-sensitive packages overnight, and the initial feasibility studies.<br> PART II describes the operating plans, initial management staff, regulatory roadblocks, and inauguration of the service.<br> PART III focuses on the company&#x2019;s continuing financial struggles and expansion of the service network.<br> PART IV recounts the growth of the organization up to the first public offering.<br> PART V explores the transformation from a startup company to a mature organization and shows the growing pains that FedEx endured.<br> PART VI looks at the corporate culture that is largely responsible for the company&#x2019;s success and how FedEx has changed the way others do business.<br> 4<br><br> FedEx today has annual revenues of $30 billion, more than 250,000 employees, and a fleet of over six hundred aircraft; operates more than 70,000 surface vehicles; and provides service to over two hundred countries, representing most of the industrial world. On a typical day, the company handles nearly six million important time-critical packages and larger freight shipments. It is, in fact, one of the largest transportation companies in the world, ranking in the top five in revenue among the world&#x2019;s airlines.<br><br> The rise of this company rests on two key innovations. The first is the hub-and-spokes network&#x2014;the system used to move packages and documents from origin to destination. The hub, located in Memphis, Tennessee, is the facility for sorting packages and documents. The spokes of the network are the routes to and from the originating cities. Packages picked up from shippers in the afternoon are flown to the hub before midnight, sorted to outbound flights within two hours, and delivered to their destination the following morning. No one had ever created such a simple and elegant process to move time-sensitive packages from place to place.<br><br> 5<br><br> However, our employees and unique supporting culture were equally important contributors to the success of the company. At several places, I refer to the &#x201c;purple blood&#x201d; attitude of the FedEx employees, borrowing a color from our logo to describe the impassioned workers who were the lifeblood of our company. I have included stories about the dedication and contributions of these remarkable individuals who stood by us from the beginning, when outsiders ridiculed our efforts and called our vision crazy. As Tom Morris observes in If Aristotle Ran General Motors, &#x201c;it is the people within any enterprise and their interactions that ultimately produce excellence or mediocrity.&#x201d;<br><br> Building Federal Express from concept to triumph was a wonderfully rewarding business adventure. Fred Smith&#x2019;s beginning concept and dynamic leadership inspired us all, but it took an incomparable workforce to turn his vision into reality. I am fortunate to have been a part of FedEx&#x2019;s incredible journey and honored to be the one putting our tale into print.</p><h2>Stage Money: The Business of the Professional Theater (Non Series)</h2><p>Stage Money is a groundbreaking guide to understanding professional theater finances today through the use of the tools and metaphors of the business world at large.

Drawing on both philosophical sources as well as theories and empirical studies in the social sciences, Mart�n Alcoff makes a strong case that identities are not like special interests, nor are they doomed to oppositional politics, nor do they inevitably lead to conformism, essentialism, or reductive approaches to judging others. Identities are historical formations and their political implications are open to interpretation. But identities such as race and gender also have a powerful visual and material aspect that eliminativists and social constructionists often underestimate.<br><br><em>Visible Identities</em> offers a careful analysis of the political and philosophical worries about identity and argues that these worries are neither supported by the empirical data nor grounded in realistic understandings of what identities are. Mart�n Alcoff develops a more realistic characterization of identity in general through combining phenomenological approaches to embodiment with hermeneutic concepts of the interpretive horizon. Besides addressing the general contours of social identity, Mart�n Alcoff develops an account of the material infrastructure of gendered identity, compares and contrasts gender identities with racialized ones, and explores the experiential aspects of racial subjectivity for both whites and non-whites. In several chapters she looks specifically at Latino identity as well, including its relationship to concepts of race, the specific forms of anti-Latino racism, and the politics of mestizo or hybrid identity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Linda Mart�n Alcoff</strong> is Director of Women's Studies and Professor of Philosophy, Women's Studies and Political Science at Syracuse University.<br><br>"With her nuanced views of these historical variable visible identities and her careful analyses and arguments against the ways alternative conceptualizations have unfolded in history and in philosophy and political theory, Linda Mart�n Alcoff has indeed, as she hoped, constructed a 'bridge"...over 'the huge gulf that separates races and genders in their country.'"--<em>Hypatia</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Lab Manual for Maders Biology</h2><p><b>THE MADER/WINDELSPECHT STORY...</b><b>The thirteenth edition of Biology is a traditional, comprehensive introductory biology textbook, with coverage from Cell Structure and Function to the Conservation of Biodiversity.

In 1750, the anatomist John Hunter described it as &#x201c;a humiliating spectacle of the futility of science&#x201d;; yet, over the next 150 years the feared, practical men of medicine benefited from a revolution in scientific progress and the increased availability of instructional textbooks. Anesthesia and antisepsis were introduced. Newly established medical schools improved surgeons&#x2019; understanding of the human body. For the first time, surgical techniques were refined, illustrated in color, and disseminated on the printed page.<br><br><em>Crucial Interventions</em> follows this evolution, drawing from magnificent examples of rare surgical textbooks from the mid-nineteenth century. Graphic and sometimes unnerving yet beautifully rendered, these fascinating illustrations, acquired from the Wellcome Collection&#x2019;s extensive archives, include step-by-step surgical techniques paired with depictions of medical instruments and depictions of operations in progress.<br><br> Arranged for the layman (from head to toe) <em>Crucial Interventions</em> is a captivating look at the early history of one of the world&#x2019;s most mysterious and macabre professions. Illustrated in color and black-and-white throughout</p><p>Richard Barnett is currently the director of studies in history, Pembroke-King&#x2019;s Program, University of Cambridge, and honorary research fellow, UCL. His writing has appeared in The Lancet, The London Magazine, and The Natural Death Handbook. He is the author of Crucial Interventions, Medical London: City of Diseases, City of Cures and The Sick Rose.&#x201c;The most striking feature of this impressive book is the very large number of images reproduced from the historical collections of the Wellcome Library. Every page is filled with vivid illustrations of surgical instruments and every conceivable surgical procedure, including many that readers may find difficult to imagine.

Among the numerous obstacles is the perception of many students that statistics is boring and pointless. One of our principal goals in this text is to engage students in the subject and to teach them that statistics is full of ideas and methods that will make them more informed users of the information they encounter every day. This worktext encourages hands-on exploration of statistical concepts so that students take an active part in the learning process. With its strong emphasis on data analysis, this book seeks to make students more discerning consumers of statistics and to give them the skills to design and execute experiments in an undergraduate research class. We have tried to present statistical concepts economically and to reinforce them immediately with activities that will make the concepts clear and vivid. </p> <p> Each chapter has cumulative material (exercises and examples). Students will encounter problems for which they must apply the knowledge learned from previous chapters. This shows students that statistics is not a collection of isolated techniques. Statistics and the scientific method provide a collection of principles and procedures for obtaining and summarizing data in order to make informed decisions. </p> <p><b>Features</b></p> <p><b>Interactive Exercises Are Built into the Text</b></p> <p> Each chapter features many <i>Let's do it!</i> activities and <i>Think about it</i> questions that draw students into the text and reinforce statistical concepts. </p> <ul> <li>In many ways, the <i>Let's do it!</i> activities are the heart of the text. These activities are designed as individual or group projects to be completed in class. These activities reinforce the concepts just introduced or lead students to discover the next statistical concept. By working with the <i>Let's do it!</i> activities, students become engaged and active participants in the material. Students soon find themselves actually doing statistics&#x2014;gathering data, analyzing the data they have collected, and discussing results with other members of their group.</li> <li>The <i>Think about it</i> questions ask students to reflect on a concept or technique just presented. <i>Think about it boxes</i> encourage students to make the leap to the next related statistical concept. The questions help students retain information and lead to new discoveries. These boxes also show students how to apply their new knowledge practically, rather than relying on rote memorization.</li> </ul> <p><b>Real Data Used in Exercises and Examples</b></p> <p> We attempt to pique interest in the examples and exercises by using data sets on current, timely topics that will engage students. The exercises and examples are drawn from newspapers, magazines, and journals with which most students will be familiar, thus underscoring the practicality of statistics. </p> <p><b>Innovative First Chapter Highlighting Major Themes</b></p> <p> Too many introductory statistics texts leave many of the most important ideas in statistics until the last few rushed class periods. We believe that students pay more attention to the path they will follow when they have some understanding of where it will lead. Consequently, in Chapter 1, "How to Make a Decision with Statistics," we introduce students to the major ideas and themes of statistics that they will use throughout the course. We show students how to work with data, make decisions in statistics, determine the chances of error, and assess the statistical significance of the results obtained at a simple level. This unique chapter gives students a grounding in statistical reasoning early on, allowing them to master the subject quickly. </p> <p><b>Early Coverage of Sampling and Experimental Design</b></p> <p> The first three chapters of this text deal with important issues in sampling. We cover practical topics, such as different sampling techniques, biases in the data, and the use of random samples. We provide a thorough introduction to factors for planning statistically valid experiments, including randomization, blinding, control groups, and the placebo effect. </p> <p><b>Up-to-Date and Lucid Treatment of Probability</b></p> <p> We have attempted to write a modern presentation of probability using examples and techniques that show how important probability is in understanding data and interpreting results. Coverage includes both estimation of probabilities through simulation and computation of probabilities through more formal results. The concepts of chance and likeliness are introduced as early as Chapter 1. This early introduction builds students' confidence in working with such concepts later. </p> <p><b>Integrated Use of Graphing Calculator to Reinforce Concepts</b></p> <p> We have found the graphing calculator to be a valuable addition to our course, allowing students to enter, plot, and summarize data quickly and conveniently. The TI-83 Plus graphing calculator has many enhanced statistical features that can be used for the more sophisticated and lengthy statistical analyses such as ANOVA, multiple comparisons, regression (simple and multiple), chi-square, and nonparametric. While the graphing calculator is not required, we rely on it in certain examples and exercises in which a calculator minimizes hand calculations and eases data plotting. More in-depth, keystroke instruction is placed in the TI Quick Steps sections that appear at the ends of selected chapters. These sections show students how to use their calculators efficiently. </p> <p><b>Changes from the First Edition</b></p> <p> Thousands of students have been successful in learning statistics from the first edition of this book, and we have made substantial improvements to the book based on feedback received from students, instructors, and reviewers. Substantive changes from the first edition include the following: </p> <ul> <li>New material has been added throughout the text to provide instructors the necessary materials to teach longer, more comprehensive courses. Additional content includes:</li> <ul> <li><i>Two-way ANOVA</i> and the concept of <i>interaction</i> have been added to Chapter 12 on Comparing Many Treatments.</li> <li>The material on <i>regression</i> has been enhanced to include more details on <i>inference</i> in linear regression and a section on <i>multiple regression.</i> The chapter on regression has also been moved to a more appropriate place as Chapter 13, entitled "Is There a Relationship Between Two or More Quantitative Variables?"</li> <li>A chapter on <i>nonparametric procedures</i> has been added as Chapter 15, which presents the common rank tests: Sign Test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and the Kruskal-Wallis Test.</li> </ul> <li><i>Double the amount of exercises</i> and updated problems throughout the text. These exercises offer an abundance of material so students can apply and assess their knowledge of learned concepts. All exercises and examples that are based on real data and news articles have a real data icon, as shown here, to readily identify such material throughout the book.</li> <li>Chapter 10 on one-sample inference has been split into two chapters. Chapter 9 covers inference about a population proportion and Chapter 10 presents inference about a population mean. The smaller pieces help the students digest this material more easily.</li> </ul> <p><b>Supplements for the Instructor</b></p> <p><b>Comprehensive Instructor's Resource Manual (by Martha Aliaga and Brenda Gunderson)</b></p> <p> To help prepare for teaching an interactive class with our text, we have developed an extensive set of materials to show the instructor how to get the most out of an interactive class. Detailed information is provided on how to set up effective student work groups, how to incorporate the graphing calculator into instruction, and how to prepare for the first day of class. Each chapter of the instructor's resource manual gives learning goals, ideas for teaching, solutions to the <i>Let's do it!</i> activities (including how long each activity takes, how to accomplish it, and its importance), solutions to the <i>Think about it questions,</i> and solutions to all of the exercises.

During the 1970s she was the first lush-lipped, long-stemmed, dark-eyed brunette to break through and become not just a model but a supermodel -- a term she coined for herself.</p><p>She graced major magazine covers from <i>Vogue</i> to <i>Elle</i> to <i>Cosmopolitan,</i> in photographs by Avedon and Irving Penn and fashions by Versace and Calvin Klein. She was voracious in everything: affairs both passionate and casual, endless partying, and a drug habit that dogged her through twenty years and three husbands. She spent her glory days with Gia Carangi and Christie Brinkley and her nights with Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, and Sylvester Stallone. And wherever she went, Janice captured the imagination of everyone who encountered her.</p><p>Yet the tale Janice Dickinson has lived to tell is no mere diva cartoon. For the haunting undercurrent in her life is a violent dance of cruelty and abuse with her own father -- a story she tells here for the first time. And as she careens from runway to rehab to rock bottom to recovery, readers will be captivated by her tale of survival . . . and by its cautionary power for anyone who still believes that fashion -- or life -- is an easy business.</p></p><p><p>She wasn't just a model. She was a <em>supermodel</em>. </p> <p>In the 1970s&#x2014;before her star turns on the <em>The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency</em> and <em>America's Next Top Model</em>&#x2014;Janice Dickinson was the lush-lipped, long-stemmed, dark-eyed brunette who became the icon for a new breed of beauty. She was voracious in everything&#x2014;from her affairs both passionate and casual to her endless partying and a drug habit that dogged her through twenty years and three husbands. Her glory days were spent working with Gia Carangi, Christie Brinkley, Valentino, and Versace, and her nights with the likes of Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, and Sylvester Stallone. <em>No Lifeguard on Duty</em> is her story&#x2014;an electrifying roller-coaster ride of fast times through three decades of fashion, fame, drugs, sex, and excess.</p><p>Janice Dickson works as a model and a phopographer in Los Angeles.

Why does light move through glass in the least amount of time possible? How can lost hikers find their way out of a forest? What will rainbows look like in the future? Why do soap bubbles have a shape that gives them the least area?</p><br><p> By combining the mathematical history of extrema with contemporary examples, Paul J. Nahin answers these intriguing questions and more in this engaging and witty volume. He shows how life often works at the extremes--with values becoming as small (or as large) as possible--and how mathematicians over the centuries have struggled to calculate these problems of minima and maxima. From medieval writings to the development of modern calculus to the current field of optimization, Nahin tells the story of Dido's problem, Fermat and Descartes, Torricelli, Bishop Berkeley, Goldschmidt, and more. Along the way, he explores how to build the shortest bridge possible between two towns, how to shop for garbage bags, how to vary speed during a race, and how to make the perfect basketball shot.</p><br><p> Written in a conversational tone and requiring only an early undergraduate level of mathematical knowledge, <i>When Least Is Best</i> is full of fascinating examples and ready-to-try-at-home experiments. This is the first book on optimization written for a wide audience, and math enthusiasts of all backgrounds will delight in its lively topics.</p></p><p><p>"This is a delightful account of how the concepts of maxima, minima, and differentiation evolved with time. The level of mathematical sophistication is neither abstract nor superficial and it should appeal to a wide audience."<b>--Ali H. Sayed, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"<i>When Least Is Best</i> is an illustrative historical walk through optimization problems as solved by mathematicians and scientists.

In <i>Healing through the Dark Emotions </i> Miriam Greenspan shows us that there's something good in so-called "bad" feelings, if we would only stop and listen to them. In a down-to-earth and engaging style, Greenspan explains why learning to attend, befriend, and surrender to emotional pain actually leads to lasting relief, as well as to greater wisdom, compassion, and a deep sense of fulfillment. Most of us don't know how to listen very well to emotional pain. This is because we have never been taught that doing so is a good thing, or how to do it. Greenspan offers a step-by-step process for opening ourselves to the wisdom of painful feelings that she calls "the alchemy of dark emotions." She focuses on three of the most common forms of emotional distress: grief, despair (a.k.a. depression), and fear. Surprisingly, when we find the courage to move toward our pain and inhabit it fully, something magical happens. Grief leads us into a state of gratitude. Despair is a doorway to faith. And fear delivers us to joy. Drawing on inspiring examples from her private practice, and integrating some unforgettable stories from her personal life, Greenspan teaches us the art and magic of keeping your heart open in the presence of pain. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, in any one year more than 18 million Americans suffer from depression. More than 19 million are diagnosed with anxiety disorders. In the midst of this alarming epidemic of emotional distress, Greenspan offers a much-needed, penetrating exploration of the causes of our suffering&#x2014;and practical advice on how to cure it. The culprit, she says, is our cultural intolerance for feeling bad. The biochemical view of emotions and other trends in our society have encouraged us to dismiss, deny, and pathologize the dark emotions. But to find peace and healing, she says, we need to cultivate a more open and trusting relationship to these feelings. We need to learn that the darkness has its own light.</p><p>Miriam Greenspan is an internationally known psychotherapist, writer, and speaker who has helped to establish the field of women's psychology. She is the acclaimed author of <i>A New Approach to Women and Therapy </i> and lives in Boston with her husband and two daughters.In this heartfelt therapeutic manifesto, psychotherapist Greenspan (A New Approach to Women and Therapy) argues that grief, fear and despair are not pathologies to be medicated away but emotions that help us grow psychologically and spiritually. The disavowal of these painful emotions (which she blames on Western culture's privileging of "masculine" reason over "feminine" emotion; lifelong lessons in suppressing emotional pain; and modern psychology's focus on "dispelling feelings, not learning from them") leads to depression, numbness and violence in both individuals and the world at large. But by "attending, befriending, and surrendering" to grief, fear and despair we can effect an "alchemical transformation" through which they become "gratitude, faith and joy." Greenspan's eclectic approach to healing invokes "depth psychology, Hasidic Judaism and Buddhist meditation"; her desire to make "meaning out of suffering" owes something to religious traditions that acknowledge the redemptive value of pain, as well as psychoanalysis's dedication to lighting up the mind's dark recesses, while her praxis includes New Age and recovery movement therapeutics such as visualization, breathing exercises, "chakra bodytalk" and prayer. Drawing on her clinical experience and her own painful recollections of the death of her infant son and her parents' travails during the Second World War, Greenspan writes intensely and compassionately. This is a committed, serious look at the emotions most of us would rather sweep under the rug. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children and Adolescents with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders</h2><p><p>This first edition text is specifically designed to help teachers work successfully with children who exhibit emotional and behavioral disorders by affording readers a comprehensive and holistic repertoire of valuable, evidence-based treatment strategies.

It is a motivating force behind all human interaction&#x2014;in families, in communities, in the business world, and in relationships at the international level. When dignity is violated, the response is likely to involve aggression, even violence, hatred, and vengeance. On the other hand, when people treat one another with dignity, they become more connected and are able to create more meaningful relationships. Surprisingly, most people have little understanding of dignity, observes Donna Hicks in this important book. She examines the reasons for this gap and offers a new set of strategies for becoming aware of dignity's vital role in our lives and learning to put dignity into practice in everyday life.</p><p>Drawing on her extensive experience in international conflict resolution and on insights from evolutionary biology, psychology, and neuroscience, the author explains what the elements of dignity are, how to recognize dignity violations, how to respond when we are not treated with dignity, how dignity can restore a broken relationship, why leaders must understand the concept of dignity, and more. Hicks shows that by choosing dignity as a way of life, we open the way to greater peace within ourselves and to a safer and more humane world for all.</p></p><p><b>Donna Hicks, Ph.D.,</b> is an associate, Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University.

And while contemporary science has revealed a great deal about the environmental impacts associated with intensive livestock production&#x2014;from greenhouse gas emissions to land and water degradation&#x2014;far less is known about the historic role science has played in rangeland management and politics. Steeped in US soil, this first history of rangeland science looks to the origins of rangeland ecology in the late nineteenth-century American West, exploring the larger political and economic forces that&#x2014;together with scientific study&#x2014;produced legacies focused on immediate economic success rather than long-term ecological well being.<br> <br> During the late 1880s and early 1890s, a variety of forces&#x2014;from the Homestead Act of 1862 to the extermination of bison, foreign investment, and lack of government regulation&#x2014;promoted free-for-all access to and development of the western range, with disastrous environmental consequences. To address the crisis, government agencies turned to scientists, but as Nathan F. Sayre shows, range science grew in a politically fraught landscape. Neither the scientists nor the public agencies could escape the influences of bureaucrats and ranchers who demanded results, and the ideas that became scientific orthodoxy&#x2014;from fire suppression and predator control to fencing and carrying capacities&#x2014;contained flaws and blind spots that plague public debates about rangelands to this day. Looking at the global history of rangeland science through the Cold War and beyond, <i>The Politics of Scale</i> identifies the sources of past conflicts and mistakes and helps us to see a more promising path forward, one in which rangeland science is guided less by capital and the state and more by communities working in collaboration with scientists.</p></p><p><b>Nathan F. Sayre</b> is professor and chair of geography at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author, most recently, of <i>Working Wilderness: The Malpai Borderlands Group and the Future of the Western Range</i>. He lives in Berkeley, CA.&#x201c;Very readable and engaging,<i> The Politics of Scale</i> is an important contribution to a number of different literatures, including the political ecology of resource management and assessment, the history and sociology of resource management science (it is one of the very best treatments in this arena), and the history of this discipline and approach. Sayre does a wonderful job showing how this intellectual history matters. His serious engagement with the methods and practices of range scientists exposes a much richer and nuanced understanding of knowledge politics as influenced by the agendas of government agencies and key individuals and the needs of capital. I love this book.&#x201d; (Matthew D. Turner, University of Wisconsin-Madison, coeditor of "Knowing Nature: Conversations at the Intersection of Political Ecology and Science Studies")<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Politics of Scale </i>provides a useful and interesting historical perspective on the development of range science as a merging of ecological understanding (some of it faulty), the economics of ranching and pastoralism, and land management policy. Rich in its historical coverage and distinctive in its focus on the evolving conceptions of range science and management, it effectively provides a genealogy of range science. I find myself reflecting frequently upon the ideas presented here. That, to me, is a mark of success.&#x201d; (David G.

When Hetty lands in prison, accused of murder and facing a sentence of execution by hanging, it is her fervent young cousin Dinah Morris, a Methodist preacher, whose intervention offers both Hetty and Adam comfort and the hope of peace.<br><br>The evocations of a lost rural world for which <i>Adam Bede</i> was so resoundingly praised on its publication in 1859 are charged in Eliot&#x2019;s hands with a personal compassion that intensifies the novel&#x2019;s outer dramas of seduction and betrayal and inner dramas of moral growth and redemption.<br><p>&nbsp;With an introduction by Leonee Ormond</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The exhilaration that comes from reading Adam Bede Owes its existence to the fact that on every page George Eliot seems absorbed in the process of spiritual discovery. The evocations of bygone rural life for which Adam Bede was so resoundingly praised on its publication in 1859 are charged with a personal passion that intensifies the novel&#39;s outer dramas of seduction and betrayal, and inner dramas of moral growth and redemption.</p><h2>The Vine That Ate the South</h2><p><p><b>Wilkes' debut is a rich and heartfelt yarn that resonates as deeply as his music." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><p>With the energy, wit, and singularity of vision that have earned him a reputation as a celebrated and charismatic musician, <i>The Vine That Ate the South</i> announces J.D. Wilkes as an accomplished storyteller on a surreal, Homeric voyage that strikes at the very heart of American mythology.</p><p>In a forgotten corner of western Kentucky lies a haunted forest referred to locally as "The Deadening," where vampire cults roam wild and time is immaterial. Our protagonist and his accomplice&#x2015;the one and only, Carver Canute&#x2015;set out down the Old Spur Line in search of the legendary Kudzu House, where an old couple is purported to have been swallowed whole by a hungry vine. Their quest leads them face to face with albino panthers, Great Dane-riding girls, protective property owners, and just about every American folk-demon ever, while forcing the protagonist to finally take stock of his relationship with his father and the man's mysterious disappearance.</p><p><em>The Vine That Ate the South</em> is a mesmerizing fantasia where Wilkes ambitiously grapples with the contradictions of the contemporary American South while subversively considering how well we know our own family and friends.</p><p><b>"It's a relentlessly fun novel, the literary equivalent of a country-punk album that grabs you and refuses to let go. Wilkes has a perfect ear for the dialect of Kentucky, and his writing is so bright, you can almost see every abandoned shack, every kudzu-covered tree. Sure, it's bizarre, and at points almost gleefully obscene, but it's undeniably one of the smartest, most original Southern Gothic novels to come along in years." &#x2015;NPR</b></p></p><p><p><b>J.D.

Chess, like love, like music, has the power to make men happy. The way to this happiness I have tried to show in this book." &#x2014; Author's Preface<br>While there are many chess instruction books available, few have achieved the lofty stature of the present volume. Fewer still have been written by a legendary International Grandmaster whose pedagogical skills rivaled the chess prowess that enabled him to demolish opponents at the board. An immediate success upon its first publication, <i>The Game of Chess</i> has become one of the game's enduring classics, considered by some critics the finest book ever written on the game.<br>Part of its success stems from Dr. Tarrasch's unorthodox approach to teaching chess: "I employ quite another method and one analogous to that a mother uses to teach her child to talk. I play with the beginner from the very start in that I put before him simple positions and from them explain the fundamentals of chess. It is the intuitive method of instruction. In this way the pupil learns chess quite easily, of that I am convinced."<br>To make it easier for the beginning student, Dr. Tarrasch also reverses the order in which the game is usually taught. Instead, he begins with the End-Game, since "obviously it is easier for the beginner to deal with a few men than the entire thirty-two." Then follows the heart of the book, an important and extensive discussion of the Middle Game. Analyzing the most important parts of hundreds of games, Tarrasch presents a comprehensive treatment of combination play, an aspect of chess for which he was especially renowned. Finally, he deals with the most complex part of the game &#x2014; the Opening &#x2014; and offers enlightening comments on many historically important variations.<br>Illustrated with over 340 diagrams and including 12 complete games, <i>The Game of Chess</i> remains one of the standard texts, a careful reading of which will improve the game of any player.</p><p>Dr Tarrasch was one of the most famous of the old school of chess masters. He was one of the original five first Grandmasters of the game. His works have been revered and recommended by chess masters throughout the twentieth century.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Ironically, many designers of graphical user interfaces are not always aware of the fundamental design rules and techniques that are applied routinely by other practitioners of communication-oriented visual design -- techniques that can be used to enhance the visual quality of GUIs, data displays, and multimedia documents.

Focuses on techniques that will not only improve the aesthetics of the visual display, but, because they promote visual organization, clarity, and conciseness, will also enhance the usability of the product. Includes a catalog of common errors drawn from existing GUI applications and environments to illustrate practices that should be avoided in developing applications. <b> </b> For anyone responsible for designing, specifying, implementing, documenting, or managing the visual appearance of computer-based information displays. </p></p><p>An excellent introduction to the design theories involved in the creation of user interfaces.

By virtue of its comprehensive coverage, strong emphasis on context, and rich, accurate art reproductions, GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES has earned and sustained a reputation of excellence and authority. So much so, that in 2001, the Text and Academic Authors Association awarded both the McGuffey and the &#34;Texty&#34; Book Prizes to the Eleventh Edition of the text. It is the first art history book to win either award and the only title ever to win both prizes in one year. The Twelfth Edition maintains and exceeds the richness of the Gardner legacy with updated research and scholarship and an even more beautiful art program featuring more color images than any other art history book available. The Twelfth Edition features such enhancements as more color photographs, a stunning new design, and the most current research and scholarship. What&#39;s more, the expanded ancillary package that accompanies GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES, features a wealth of tools to enhance your students&#39; experience in the course. With each new copy of the book, students receive a copy of the ArtStudy 2.0 CD-ROM--an interactive electronic study aid that fully integrates with the Twelfth Edition and includes hundreds of high-quality digital images, plus maps, quizzes, and more.</p><p>Fred S.

They are the anonymous heroes who protect us everyday from the threats we&#x2019;ll never know existed.</p><p>Delta Force. They are the U.S. Army's most elite top-secret strike force. They dominate the modern battlefield, but you won't hear about their heroics on CNN. No headlines can reveal their top-secret missions, and no book has ever taken readers inside-until now. Here, a founding member of Delta Force takes us behind the veil of secrecy and into the action-to reveal the never-before-told story of 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-D (Delta Force). <br>INSIDE DELTA FORCE<br>THE STORY OF AMERICA'S ELITE <br>COUNTERTERRORIST UNIT <br>He is a master of espionage, trained to take on hijackers, terrorists, hostage takers, and enemy armies. He can deploy by parachute or arrive by commercial aircraft. Survive alone in hostile cities. Speak foreign languages fluently. Strike at enemy targets with stunning swiftness and extraordinary teamwork. He is the ultimate modern warrior: the Delta Force Operator. <br>In this dramatic behind-the-scenes chronicle, Eric Haney, one of the founding members of Delta Force, takes us inside this legendary counterterrorist unit. Here, for the first time, are details of the grueling selection process-designed to break the strongest of men-that singles out the best of the best: the Delta Force Operator. <br>With heart-stopping immediacy, Haney tells what it's really like to enter a hostage-held airplane. And from his days in Beirut, Haney tells an unforgettable tale of bodyguards and bombs, of a day-to-day life of madness and beauty, and of how he and a teammate are called on to kill two gunmen targeting U.S. Marines at the Beirut airport. As part of the team sent to rescue American hostages in Tehran, Haney offers a first-person description of that failedmission that is a chilling, compelling account of a bold maneuver undone by chance-and a few fatal mistakes. <br>From fighting guerrilla warfare in Honduras to rescuing missionaries in Sudan and leading the way onto the island of Grenada, Eric Haney captures the daring and discipline that distinguish the men of Delta Force. Inside Delta Force brings honor to these singular men while it puts us in the middle of action that is sudden, frightening, and nonstop around the world. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>"In this rapidly changing and dangerous world, U.S. Special Forces are vital to the security of all Americans.

Wilkins Freeman<br><br>THE SNOW WAS falling, and the Cat&#x2019;s fur was stiffly pointed with it, but he was imperturbable. He sat crouched, ready for the death-spring, as he had sat for hours. It was night &#x2013; but that made no difference &#x2013; all times were as one to the Cat when he was in wait for prey. Then too, he was under no constraint of human will, for he was living alone that winter. Nowhere in the world was any voice calling him; on no hearth was there a waiting dish. He was quite free except for his own desires, which tyrannized over him when unsatisfied as now. The Cat was very hungry &#x2013; almost famished, in fact. For days the weather had been very bitter, and all the feebler wild things which were his prey by inheritance, the born serfs to his family, had kept, for the most part, in their burrows and nests, and the Cat&#x2019;s long hunt had availed him nothing. But he waited with the inconceivable patience and persistency of his race; besides, he was certain. The Cat was a creature of absolute convictions, and his faith in his deductions never wavered. The rabbit had gone in there between those low-hung pine boughs. Now her little doorway had before it a shaggy curtain of snow, but in there she was. The Cat had seen her enter, so like a swift grey shadow that even his sharp and practised eyes had glanced back for the substance following, and then she was gone. So he sat down and waited, and he waited still in the white night, listening angrily to the north wind starting in the upper heights of the mountains with distant screams, then swelling into an awful crescendo of rage, and swooping down with furious white wings of snow like a flock of fierce eagles into the valleys and ravines. The Cat was on the side of a mountain, on a wooded terrace. Above him a few feet away towered the rock ascent as steep as the wall of a cathedral. The Cat had never climbed it &#x2013; trees were the ladders to his heights of life. He had often looked with wonder at the rock, and miauled bitterly and resentfully as man does in the face of a forbidding Providence. At his left was the sheer precipice. Behind him, with a short stretch of woody growth between, was the frozen perpendicular wall of a mountain stream. Before him was the way to his home. When the rabbit came out she was trapped; her little cloven feet could not scale such unbroken steeps. So the Cat waited. The place in which he was looked like a maelstrom of the wood. The tangle of trees and bushes clinging to the mountain-side with a stern clutch of roots, the prostrate trunks and branches, the vines embracing everything with strong knots and coils of growth, had a curious effect, as of things which had whirled for ages in a current of raging water, only it was not water, but wind, which had disposed everything in circling lines of yielding to its fiercest points of onset. And now over all this whirl of wood and rock and dead trunks and branches and vines descended the snow. It blew down like smoke over the rock-crest above; it stood in a gyrating column like some death-wraith of nature, on the level, then it broke over the edge of the precipice, and the Cat cowered before the fierce backward set of it. It was as if ice needles pricked his skin through his beautiful thick fur, but he never faltered and never once cried. He had nothing to gain from crying, and everything to lose; the rabbit would hear him cry and know he was waiting.<br><br>It grew darker and darker, with a strange white smother, instead of the natural blackness of night. It was a night of storm and death superadded to the night of nature. The mountains were all hidden, wrapped about, overawed, and tumultuously overborne by it, but in the midst of it waited, quite unconquered, this little, unswerving, living patience and power under a little coat of grey fur.<br><br>A fiercer blast swept over the rock, spun on one mighty foot of whirlwind athwart the level, then was over the precipice.<br><br>Then the Cat saw two eyes luminous with terror, frantic with the impulse of flight, he saw a little, quivering, dilating nose, he saw two pointing ears, and he kept still, with every one of his fine nerves and muscles strained like wires. Then the rabbit was out &#x2013; there was one long line of incarnate flight and terror &#x2013; and the Cat had her.<br><br>Then the Cat went home, trailing his prey through the snow.<br><br>The Cat lived in the house which his master had built, as rudely as a child&#x2019;s block-house, but staunchly enough. The snow was heavy on the low slant of its roof, but it would not settle under it. The two windows and the door were made fast, but the Cat knew a way in. Up a pine-tree behind the house he scuttled, though it was hard work with his heavy rabbit, and was in his little window under the eaves, then down through the trap to the room below, and on his master&#x2019;s bed with a spring and a great cry of triumph, rabbit and all. But his master was not there; he had been gone since early fall and it was now February.He would not return until spring, for he was an old man, and the cruel cold of the mountains clutched at his vitals like a panther, and he had gone to the village to winter. The Cat had known for a long time that his master was gone, but his reasoning was always sequential and circuitous; always for him what had been would be, and the more easily for his marvellous waiting powers so he always came home expecting to find his master. <br><br>When he saw that he was still gone, he dragged the rabbit off the rude couch which was the bed to the floor, put one little paw on the carcass to keep it steady, and began gnawing with head to one side to bring his strongest teeth to bear.<br><br>It was darker in the house than it had been in the wood, and the cold was as deadly, though not so fierce. If the Cat had not received his fur coat unquestioningly of Providence, he would have been thankful that he had it. It was a mottled grey, white on the face and breast, and thick as fur could grow.<br><br>The wind drove the snow on the windows with such force that it rattled like sleet, and the house trembled a little. Then all at once the Cat heard a noise, and stopped gnawing his rabbit and listened, his shining green eyes fixed upon a window. Then he heard a hoarse shout, a halloo of despair and entreaty; but he knew it was not his master come home, and he waited, one paw still on the rabbit. Then the halloo came again, and then the Cat answered. He said all that was essential quite plainly to his own comprehension. There was in his cry of response inquiry, information, warning, terror, and finally, the offer of comradeship; but the man outside did not hear him, because of the howling of the storm.<br><br>Then there was a great battering pound at the door, then another, and another. The Cat dragged his rabbit under the bed. The blows came thicker and faster. It was a weak arm which gave them, but it was nerved by desperation. Finally the lock yielded, and the stranger came in. Then the Cat, peering from under the bed, blinked with a sudden light, and his green eyes narrowed. The stranger struck a match and looked about. The Cat saw a face wild and blue with hunger and cold, and a man who looked poorer and older than his poor old master, who was an outcast among men for his poverty and lowly mystery of antecedents; and he heard a muttered, unintelligible voicing of distress from the harsh piteous mouth. There was in it both profanity and prayer, but the Cat knew nothing of that.<br><br>The stranger braced the door which he had forced, got some wood from the stock in the corner, and kindled a fire in the old stove as quickly as his half-frozen hands would allow. He shook so pitiably as he worked that the Cat under the bed felt the tremor of it. Then the man, who was small and feeble and marked with the scars of suffering which he had pulled down upon his own head, sat down in one of the old chairs and crouched over the fire as if it were the one love and desire of his soul, holding out his yellow hands like yellow claws, and he groaned. The Cat came out from under the bed and leaped up on his lap with the rabbit. The man gave a great shout and start of terror, and sprang, and the Cat slid clawing to the floor, and the rabbit fell inertly, and the man leaned, gasping with fright, and ghastly, against the wall. The Cat grabbed the rabbit by the slack of its neck and dragged it to the man&#x2019;s feet. Then he raised his shrill, insistent cry, he arched his back high, his tail was a splendid waving plume. He rubbed against the man&#x2019;s feet, which were bursting out of their torn shoes.<br><br>The man pushed the Cat away, gently enough, and began searching about the little cabin. He even climbed painfully the ladder to the loft, lit a match, and peered up in the darkness with straining eyes.He feared lest there might be a man, since there was a cat. His experience with men had not been pleasant, and neither had the experience of men been pleasant with him. He was an old wandering Ishmael among his kind; he had stumbled upon the house of a brother, and the brother was not at home, and he was glad.<br><br>He returned to the Cat, and stooped stiffly and stroked his back, which the animal arched like the spring of a bow.<br><br>Then he took up the rabbit and looked at it eagerly by the firelight. His jaws worked. He could almost have devoured it raw. He fumbled &#x2013; the Cat close at his heels &#x2013; around some rude shelves and a table, and found, with a grunt of self-gratulation, a lamp with oil in it. That he lighted; then he found a frying-pan and a knife, and skinned the rabbit, and prepared it for cooking, the Cat always at his feet.<br><br>When the odour of the cooking flesh filled the cabin, both the man and the Cat looked wolfish. The man turned the rabbit with one hand and stooped to pat the Cat with the other. The Cat thought him a fine man. He loved him with all his heart, though he had known him such a short time, and though the man had a face both pitiful and sharply set at variance with the best of things.<br><br>It was a face with the grimy grizzle of age upon it, with fever hollows in the cheeks, and the memories of wrong in the dim eyes, but the Cat accepted the man unquestioningly and loved him. When the rabbit was half cooked, neither the man nor the Cat would wait any longer. The man took it from the fire, divided it exactly in halves, gave the Cat one, and took the other himself. Then they ate.</p><h2>Pathways to Astronomy</h2><p><i>Pathways to Astronomy</i> breaks down introductory astronomy into its component parts.

Practical and romantic, idea-filled and beautiful, it is imbued with the Smith &amp; Hawken sensibility: quality, authenticity, and a return to the old ways. There are chapters on the history of the potting shed. The gardener's tools, and how to store and care for them. And seasonal joys and labors, including spring--with tips on germinating seeds, using cloches, transplanting seedlings; summer--the time for picking flowers for potpourri; fall--how to dry herbs, plant spring-blooming bulbs, and gather seeds for next year; and winter--when it's time to relax in front of the woodstove and pore over catalogs. Whether the "potting shed" is a cleared-off space on a kitchen counter, a corner in the garage, an old table and wash basin against the side of the house--or an actual shed--<i>The Potting Shed</i> is every gardener's dream of where the garden begins.

It has revolutionized the way we learn about and communicate with the world and has reinvented the way we experience ourselves and others. More than just cheap entertainment, TV is an undeniable component of our culture and contains many clues to who we are, what we value, and where we might be headed in the future.<br><br>Media historian Gary R. Edgerton follows the technological developments and increasing cultural relevance of TV from its prehistory (before 1947) to the Network Era (1948-1975) and the Cable Era (1976-1994). He begins with the laying of the first telegraph line in 1844, which gave rise to the idea that images and sounds could be transmitted over long distances. He then considers the remodeling of television's look and purpose during World War II; the gender, racial, and ethnic components of its early broadcasts and audiences; its transformation of postwar America; and its function in the political life of the country. He talks of the birth of prime time and cable, the influence of innovators like Sylvester "Pat" Weaver, Roone Arledge, and Ted Turner, as well as television's entrance into the international market, describing the ascent of such programs as <i>Dallas</i> and <i>The Cosby Show</i>, and the impact these exports have had on transmitting American culture abroad. <br><br>Edgerton concludes with a discerning look at our current Digital Era (1995-present) and the new forms of instantaneous communication that continue to change America's social, political, and economic landscape. Richly researched and engaging, Edgerton's history tracks television's growth into a convergent technology, a global industry, a social catalyst, a viable art form, and a complex and dynamic reflection of the American mind and character. It took only ten years for television to penetrate thirty-five million households, and by 1983, the average home kept their set on for more than seven hours a day. <i>The Columbia History of American Television</i> illuminates our complex relationship with this singular medium and provides historical and critical knowledge for understanding TV as a technology, an industry, an art form, and an institutional force.</p><p>Richly researched and engaging, The Columbia History of American Television tracks the growth of TV into a convergent technology, a global industry, a social catalyst, a viable art form, and a complex and dynamic reflection of the American mind and character.

The title of the book, Power &amp; Choice, indicates a subsidiary theme that recurs at intervals. We may view politics as (1) the use of power or (2) the production of a public choice. Often one or the other is heavily emphasized in approaching the subject. Marxism emphasizes politics as the use of power, while pluralism and much formal modeling work emphasize the emergence of public choices.</p><p>W.

This magnificent book describes the great country houses built with American industrial fortunes from the end of the Civil War until 1940. Written by Clive Aslet, author of a widely acclaimed study of English country houses of this period, <i>The American Country House</i> draws on the rich and often amusing writings of contemporaries to evoke the lives the buildings served as well as the architectural shapes that they took. &nbsp;According to Aslet, the American country house was in part an attempt to import aristocratic ways from Europe, but it became far more than this, and took specifically American forms to serve specific American needs. More opulent than their European prototypes and technologically more advanced, American country houses exhibited a surprising variety of style and purpose. Aslet notes that many of these houses were inspired by a desire to escape the congested and disease-ridden cities. But life in the country was a daunting prospect for many owners, who therefore chose to establish themselves within striking distance of others of their kind&#x2015;along the Hudson Valley, on the Philadelphia Main Line, in the Berkshires or the Adirondacks, on Long Island, in Lake Forest, or in the balmy climate of California or Florida. &nbsp;Describing the houses that were built in these areas, Aslet also portrays the rural pursuits followed by the owners: farming (of a gentlemanly kind), hunting on horseback, tennis, golf, sailing, flying, and motor racing. This richly textured and wealthy lifestyle produced architecture of great distinction and provides Aslet with a canvas on which to draw an entertaining and original portrait of&nbsp;the creativity and the conspicuous consumption of American upper classes in their golden age.</p><p><p><b>Clive Aslet </b>is deputy editor of <i>Country Life </i>and<i> </i>author of <i>The Last Country Homes.</i></p>&#x201c;Written in a sprightly style, richly illustrated, Aslet&#x2019;s book is particularly inviting to the general reader.&#x201d;--Merle Rubin, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br><br>"Aslet analyzes how the country house embodied strongly American qualities, focusing on the sometimes frivolous activities of the estate owners, their families, and their friends. . . . Lively reading and should appeal to historian and layperson alike."&#x2014;Library Journal<br><br><br>&#x201c;An amusing and enjoyable account of moneyed idealism. . . .

This is a book to keep for rereading -- <i>John Timmerman, professor of English, Calvin College</i><br><br>Though many are accustomed to lookingto Spurgeon as a model for sermonic inspiration, theological understanding, evangelistic fervor, dedication to truth, devotional comfort, and even entertaining humor, this book will inspire us to consider Spurgeon in the darker times of despondency. If such a humble and mighty servant of God as Spurgeon suffered these agonies, may others not profit from the study of his experiences, so wonderfully spread before us by Elizabeth Skoglund? -- <i>Bob L.

Did you know that germs make your stomach growl as they break down your food? Or that they can travel the world on anything from fleas and ticks to trains and buses? <br>Told from the perspective of Sam the Salmonella, this informative picture book introduces young readers to helpful and harmful germs, exploring their discovery; the breakout of historic diseases; the invention of pasteurization, vaccination, and penicillin; and other fascinating details about the world of microscopic organisms. </p><p><b>A Christy Ottaviano Book</b></p></p><p><p><b>Lesa Cline-Ransome </b>is the author of many picture books, including<i> Young Pele: Soccer&#x2019;s First Star,</i> <i>Light in the Darkness</i> and <i>Whale Trails: Before and Now </i>which was a Kirkus Reviews Best Book of the Year, and which <i>Kirkus</i> praised as &#x201c;an inventive look at maritime history&#x201d; in a starred review.

He teaches illustration at Syracuse University and lives with his family in upstate New York.</p>K-Gr 2&#x2014;An informational picture book dedicated to the icky, sticky, and disgusting world of germs. The work is narrated by Sam the Salmonella, an anthropomorphized strain of the bacteria, and is thematically divided into two sections: the evolution of human understanding of germs, and the positive and negative aspects of the microorganisms. Sam takes readers on a journey through time, from the belief that evil spirits caused disease to the discoveries of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Louis Pasteur. The second half begins rather abruptly, with Sam decrying the damage done by yellow fever, black death, and scarlet fever and blaming these insidious germs for overshadowing the beneficial effects that "good" bacteria have had on the world, specifically in regard to food creation and decomposition of organic matter. While the narrative is a bit uneven in tone, the playful color illustrations of people and germ types provide a consistently edifying backdrop to the text. However, an image of a male pilgrim and a Native American man sharing a plate of corn may prove to be problematic. VERDICT An adequate introduction to the world of germs for young elementary students.&#x2014;Colleen S.

It also comes as part of the complete set complete set (ISBN 1598560360). Emphasizing the beliefs common to all branches of Christendom rather than the issues that divide, Thomas Oden brings the full weight of two millennia of discussion to bear on the ever-contemporary questions of Christian faith. His magisterial study not only treats the traditional elements of systematic theology, referencing hundreds of theologians-Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, charismatic-but also highlights the foundational exegetes of history. Broadly ecumenical in the truest sense of the word, and written from the perspective of a theological liberal-turned-evangelical, Oden&#39;s direct, frank, and provocative approach articulates the concerns of a broad spectrum of Christians-pastors, teachers, seminarians, and thoughtful laity.</p><p>Thomas C. Oden is the Henry Anson Buttz Professor of Theology, Drew University, Madison, New Jersey.Born in 1931 and, theologically, a former left-wing radical, Oden in the 1980s started to ground his theology in the study of the church fathers and the New Testament. It is in this spirit that he offered a three-volume &#34;Systematic Theology.&#34; First published in 1987/92, it is now offered as a reprint. One may describe Oden as an independently thinking evangelical theologian with a strong interest in basing ecumenical Christian teaching on the church fathers. &#34;International Review of Biblical Studies&#34;&#34;</p><h2>5 Steps to a 5: AP Calculus AB 2020 (5 Steps to a 5 AP Calculus AB/BC)</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br><b>Get ready to ace your AP Calculus Exam with this easy-to-follow, multi-platform study guide</b>&nbsp;The immensely popular test prep guide has been updated and revised with new material and is now accessible in print, online, and mobile formats.&nbsp;<i>5 Steps to a 5: AP Calculus 2020</i> introduces an easy to follow, effective 5-step study plan to help you build the skills, knowledge, and test-taking confidence you need to reach your full potential.

His scholarly work has been recognized by the award of a D. Litt from University of York and an honorary doctorate from University of Bucharest, by his election as a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society and as a Corresponding Fellow of the South African Society for Medieval and Renaissance Studies.<br>Reference sources on antiques abound, but <i>The Grove Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts </i>is the first comprehensive, scholarly encyclopedia of the decorative arts. Campbell, professor of Renaissance studies at the University of Leicester, followed the collecting principles of the Victoria and Albert Museum to determine the scope of the work, selecting "entries on subjects that one might reasonably expect to find in a book with this title." <p>The encyclopedia has 3,000 entries, 2,000 of which are updated versions of those in <i>The Dictionary of Art </i>(1996) and <i>Grove Art </i>Online. Contributors are listed, but articles are unsigned because Campbell wrote many of the revisions and new entries himself. The work is the first in a planned series of print reference sources based on <i>Grove Art Online</i> for "scholars, collectors, curators, students, researchers, and general readers." Entries range from one sentence (e.g., <i>Air-twist,</i> a "spiral of air bubbles used for decorative effect in the stem of a wine-glass") to more than 10 pages on <i>Carpet, Tapestry, Textile, Tile, </i>and <i>Toys and games.</i> </p><p>Campbell focuses on museum pieces rather than popular or folk art; for example, the encyclopedia includes Faberge gold-and-enamel Easter eggs but not Ukrainian painted eggs. Emphasis is on western Europe. For example, the article on <i>Arms</i> is subtitled <i>European Edge Weapons</i> and excludes samurai swords. Coverage of China, India, and Japan is more extensive than that of Africa, Latin America, or Native American cultures. The index includes only four single-page references for Mexico (in <i>Dolls, Papercutting</i>, <i>Rugs</i>, and <i>Textiles</i>); <i>Grove Art Online</i> also covers Mexican gold and silver, ceramics, and furniture. New articles emphasize individuals, design groups, and materials (e.g., <i>Bark cloth; Colt, Samuel; Lapis lazuli; Swarovski Austrian Glass Company;</i> and <i>Willow pattern)</i>.</p><p>The set has 600 illustrations, with color plates in the center of each volume.

Juergensmeyer explores the 1993 World Trade Center explosion, Hamas suicide bombings, the Tokyo subway nerve gas attack, and the killing of abortion clinic doctors in the United States. His personal interviews with 1993 World Trade Center bomber Mahmud Abouhalima, Christian Right activist Mike Bray, Hamas leaders Sheik Yassin and Abdul Azis Rantisi, and Sikh political leader Simranjit Singh Mann, among others, take us into the mindset of those who perpetrate and support violence in the name of religion.</p><p>"By studying different 'cultures of violence' Mark Juergensmeyer has provided a plausible and imaginative interpretation of this phenomenon.

This is an important contribution to our knowledge of the relationship between religion and violence."&#x2014;Martha Crenshaw, editor of <i>Terrorism in Context </i><br><br>"In this important book Juergensmeyer argues that the violence associated with religion is not an aberration but comes from the fundamental structures of the belief system of all major religions.

How can the word of God sanction acts of terror against human beings ? How can violence become a sacred duty ? These are the questions at the heart of Mark Juergensmeyer's calm, lucid, insightful and compassionate book.

This is especially true when you are working with time constraints or in settings where contacts with the client will be brief. <em>Brief Interventions for Radical Change</em> is a powerful resource for any clinician working with clients who are struggling with mental health, substance abuse, or life adjustment issues. If you are searching for a more focused therapeutic approach that requires fewer follow-up visits with clients, or if you are simply looking for a way to make the most of each session, this is your guide.</p> <p> In this book, you&#x2019;ll find a ready-to-use collection of brief assessment and case-formulation tools, as well as many brief intervention strategies based in focused acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). These tools and strategies can be used to help your clients stop using unworkable behaviors, and instead engage in committed, values-based actions to change their lives for the better.</p> <p> The book includes a practical approach to understanding how clients get stuck, focusing questions to help clients redefine their problem, and tools to increase motivation for change. In addition, you will learn methods for rapidly constructing effective treatment plans and effective interventions for promoting acceptance, present-moment awareness, and contact with personal values.</p> <p> With this book, you will easily integrate important mindfulness, acceptance, and values-based therapeutic work in their interactions with clients suffering from depression, anxiety, or any other mental health problem.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kirk Strosahl, PhD</strong>, is a cofounder of acceptance and commitment therapy, a cognitive behavioral therapy that has gained widespread adoption in the mental health and substance abuse community.

She is a Fellow of Somerville College, OxfordSimon Callow performs, rather than simply reads, Shakespeare's sonnets, changing tone and expression to fit thought and emotion, bringing the poems to life as if they were a character's lines. The program is unadorned, without music or voicing, letting the listener enjoy the poetry without distraction. What seems an occasional flaw in Callow's otherwise impeccable reading, a "dost" where a "doth" should be, may be textual variants. It will be difficult, however, for a listener unfamiliar with these dense, allusive poems to absorb them from this fine program alone, or even following a text. It would best serve as a refresher, or as an aid to a new reader or student.

In <i>How Global Currencies Work</i>, three noted economists provide a reassessment of this history and the theories behind the conventional wisdom.</p><p>Offering a new history of global finance over the past two centuries, and marshaling extensive new data to test established theories of how global currencies work, Barry Eichengreen, Arnaud Mehl, and Livia Chi&#x163;u argue for a new view, in which several national monies can share international currency status, and their importance can change rapidly. They demonstrate how changes in technology and in the structure of international trade and finance have reshaped the landscape of international currencies so that several international financial standards can coexist. They show that multiple international and reserve currencies have in fact coexisted in the past&#x2015;upending the traditional view of the British pound&#x2019;s dominance prior to 1945 and the U.S. dollar&#x2019;s dominance more recently.</p><p>Looking forward, the book tackles the implications of this new framework for major questions facing the future of the international monetary system, from whether the euro and the Chinese yuan might address their respective challenges and perhaps rival the dollar, to how increased currency competition might affect global financial stability.</p></p><p><p>"This book will come to be known as the one that challenged the old, winner-takes-all view of international currency competition and established the new view. Barry Eichengreen and his coauthors present thorough and telling evidence that the historical reality is that multiple currencies play consequential roles in international trade and finance--and that lock-in effects and persistence are not as strong as traditionally assumed. In short, this is a must-read for all economists interested in international macroeconomics and finance."<b>--Richard Baldwin, Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva</b></p><p>"Barry Eichengreen, our pre-eminent international monetary historian, and his coauthors have written a great book around the central theme that there have almost always been multiple rival international currencies and that the advantages of being the world's lead currency are not as marked as traditionally argued. The book is lucidly written, eschewing mathematical technicalities, though the background scholarship is deeply impressive. It should be read by everyone interested in the monetary history of the past two centuries."<b>--Charles Goodhart, London School of Economics and Political Science</b></p><p>"This eloquent and learned book will become the standard--perhaps one should say the gold standard--for discussions of international currency regimes, and for the analysis of the uncertainties that accompany changing global leadership."<b>--Harold James, Princeton University</b></p><p>"The authors put the plural back into global currencies, for good reason. As their historical but highly topical research establishes, there can be more than one global (or &#x2018;reserve') currency at any one time, as has often been the case in the modern world. This is an important corrective to the recurring oversold yen then euro then yuan will rival the dollar litany. But it is also a reminder that there is more to a stable global financial system than how many currencies there are, but how the leaders of those currencies take responsibility and interact."<b>Adam S. Posen, President, Peterson Institute for International Economics</b></p><p>"Drawing on new data, this book provides a rich contextual and historical analysis of reserve currencies in the global economy. This is very welcome, indeed."<b>--Sebastian Edwards, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><b>Barry Eichengreen</b> is the George C. Pardee and Helen N.

Now two pioneering scientists draw on their years of experience in paleontology, biology, chemistry, and astrobiology to deliver an eye-opening narrative using a generation's worth of insights culled from new research. </p><p>Writing with zest, humor, and clarity, Ward and Kirschvink show that many of our long-held beliefs about the history of life are wrong. Three central themes emerge. First, Ward and Kirschvink argue that catastrophe shaped life's history more than all other forces combined--from notorious events like the sudden extinction of dinosaurs to the recently discovered "Snowball Earth" and the "Great Oxygenation Event." Second, life consists of carbon, but oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide determined how it evolved. Third, ever since Darwin we have thought of evolution in terms of species. Yet it is the evolution of ecosystems--from deep-ocean vents to rainforests--that has formed the living world as we know it. Ward and Kirschvink tell a story of life on Earth that is at once fabulous and familiar. And in a provocative coda, they assemble discoveries from the latest cutting-edge research to imagine how the history of life might unfold deep into the future.</p></p><p><b>Peter Ward</b>, professor of biology and earth and space sciences at the University of Washington, has authored seventeen books, including the prizewinning RARE EARTH<i> </i>with Donald Brownlee.

From Casanova to Benjamin Franklin to the Kardashians, individuals throughout history have recorded their own lives and experiences. These personal writings are central to the work of literary critics, philosophers, historians, and psychologists, who have found in autobiographies from across the centuries not only an understanding of the ways in which lives have been lived, but the most fundamental accounts of what it means to be a self in the world. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Laura Marcus defines what we mean by "autobiography," and considers its relationship with similar literary forms such as memoirs, journals, letters, diaries, and essays. Analyzing the core themes in autobiographical writing, such as confession, conversion and testimony, romanticism and the journeying self; Marcus discusses the autobiographical consciousness (and the roles played by time, memory and identity), and considers the relationship between psychoanalysis and autobiography. Exploring the themes of self-portraiture and performance, Marcus also discusses the ways in which fiction and autobiography have shaped each other.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

He is an accomplished guitarist and trumpet player and has performed on both instruments in a wide variety of professional settings. He is experienced as a performer and composer of music ranging from jazz and rock to the classics and sacred. He received his bachelor&#39;s degree from Washington University in St. Louis and his master&#39;s from the University of Missouri. Bill has received international acclaim for his innovative teaching methods, and he has authored over 200 books with sales in the millions. Mel Bay was born on February 25, 1913 in the little Ozark Mountain town of Bunker, Missouri. He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first &#34;gig.&#34; (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no &#34;gig&#34; was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel&#39;s words, &#34;a snake oil salesman.&#34; This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his &#34;wonder elixer.&#34; In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI&#39;s wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950&#39;s. Things have continued to grow ever since. Mel used to sell D&#39;Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 &#34;lying around the house.&#34; Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D&#39;Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a &#34;cut away&#34; model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades.</p><h2>Five Children and It</h2><p>While exploring the environs of their summer home, five brothers and sisters find a Psammead, or Sand-fairy, in a nearby gravel pit: &#x201c;Its eyes were on long horns like a snail&#x2019;s eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat&#x2019;s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider&#x2019;s and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey&#x2019;s.&#x201d; The Psammead is magical and, every day, the ancient and irritable creature grants each of them a wish that lasts until sunset. Soon, though, they find their wishes never seem to turn out right and often have unexpected&#x2014;and humorous&#x2014;consequences. But when an accidental wish goes terribly wrong, the children learn that magic, like life, can be as complicated as it is exciting.

Every day &#39;It&#39; will grant each of them a wish that lasts until sunset, often with disastrous consequences. Five Children and It was first published in 1902, and it has remained in print ever since. The Introduction to this edition examines Nesbit&#39;s life and her reading, showing how she was poised between the Victorian world and a new era in which children in literature were no longer mere projections of the adult viewpoint. Sandra Kemp examines how the narrative is structured around the acting out of literary fantasies, which always come down to earth. Nesbit combines wonderfully implausible events with the prosaic and familiar, and Kemp illuminates her exploration of the shifting relationship between imagination, literature, and life.<b>Edith Nesbit</b> (1858 &#x2013; 1924), was a mischievous, tomboyish child who grew up to be an unconventional adult. She and her husband were founding members of the socialist Fabian Society and their home became a center for socialist and literary discussion. Their friends included some of the greatest writers and thinkers of the time, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells.&nbsp;Edith broke the mould demanded of women by English society at the time &#x2013; she expressed her individuality through her self-presentation and her habit of speaking forcefully on almost any subject.<p>E. Nesbit &#x2013; she always used the plain initial for her writing and was sometimes thought to be a man &#x2013; started to write for children after years of successful writing for adult magazines. She was asked to write about her childhood but instead of facts chose to describe her happy girlhood in fiction. Thus were written the books that are still read today, and which have been firm bestsellers for decades. She was brilliant at combining real-life situations with elements of fantasy and humour. Films &#x2013;such as <b>The Railway Children</b> - have kept her stories in the public eye, and her magical fantasies, including <b>Five Children and It</b>, continue to delight each new generation of children.</p></p><h2>Child Development (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Most balanced presentation of research and applications</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Feldman&#x2019;s <i>Child Development, 6e</i> offers students a balanced and up-to-date study of theory and research with a focus on application to students&#x2019; personal lives and future careers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Child Development 6e</i> introduces students to the theories, research, and applications of child and adolescent development.

One of Rome's most memorable and keenly observant writers, his letters to friends and family are an astonishingly detailed record of daily life and politics in Rome. Here is the largest one-volume selection of Cicero's letters currently available, documenting Cicero's tumultuous career and providing a month-by-month record of the final collapse of the Roman senatorial government. Covering the years 68-43 BC, the letters illuminate events from the high point of Cicero's consulship of 63, through the humiliation of his exile and subsequent subjection to the dynasts, to the assassination of Caesar in 44, and Cicero's brief hour of glory in leading senatorial resistance to the tyranny of Mark Antony. In P. G. Walsh's lively new translation, Cicero's correspondence brings to life once more all the intrigue, excitement, and danger of ancient Rome.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

In this beautiful book, William Hood analyzes the newly cleaned frescoes at San Marco, setting them against the background of fifteenth-century Florentine artistic, political, cultural, and religious history.<br>Hood discusses the ideals, daily rituals, and pictorial traditions of the Dominican order - especially the reformed or Observant branch to which Fra Angelico belonged. He presents new material on traditions of religious art, altarpiece design and imagery, and the decoration of chapter rooms and cloisters. Hood compares Fra Angelico's work at San Marco to earlier Dominican altarpieces and to his other altarpieces for Dominican buildings in Siena, Pisa, Prato, and Florence, pointing out both the traditional elements and the startling novelty of the San Marco altarpiece. Similarly, by comparing San Marco to other Florentine fresco cycles, he illuminates the originality of the cloister and chapter-house of San Marco. Hood's discussion of San Marco follows an itinerary through the church and adjoining convent buildings, beginning with the high altarpiece and ending with the corridor paintings - especially the exquisite Annunciation in the corridor of the north dormitory. Throughout, he analyzes Angelico's use of color, his technique in fresco and tempera, the way he solved specific visual problems, and how his paintings affected fifteenth-century viewers. This beautiful book will be an important addition to our understanding of fifteenth-century art and of artistic and cultural practices.</p><p>Sponsored by the Medici, Fra Angelico's paintings for the priory of San Marco are among the foremost monuments in early Renaissance Florence. This extraordinary cycle, though stylistically au courant, emerges out of a tradition of sacred subject matter favored by the artist's Observant Dominican order. Hood's masterful study persuasively reconstructs the link between the paintings and the institutional spirituality articulated in the order's liturgical habits and literary traditions. While rejecting the notion of a unified iconographic program, the author ably demonstrates the formal and didactic intentions that underlie Angelico's artistic and intellectual choices. Hood's profound understanding of the Observants' religious mentality and its committed expression in the artist's work are complemented by a comprehensive grasp of the art historical context and a keen ability to articulate the paintings' nuances of style. An exquisite corpus of reproductions further enhances an exemplary scholarly labor.

Most of those collected here were written in 1940, when Sartre was in the military and then in prison camp. Sartre writes, sometimes twice a day, mostly about waiting: for letters (his constant complaint), information, money, leave, action--and books, noting the absurdity of a soldier requesting Shakespeare in the battle zone: ``It reeks of espionage.'' Many letters concern his feelings, his flirtations, and his affair with ``Tania''--a classy ``slut'' Sartre offers to marry even though it's ``Beaver'' (his pet name for Beauvoir) whom, in spite of her predilection for women, he considers his soulmate. Ten years into his creative relationship with Beauvoir, Sartre admits to being ``disgusted'' with himself--for his promiscuity and ``obscene'' sexuality--and solicits her advice. But however she inspires him, he addresses her in the common language of an adolescent crush, always in the diminutive, ``little'' this and ``little'' that, even ``little paragon.'' It's in this period of discipline, confinement, and boredom, however, that Sartre produces his greatest works-- Being and Nothingness, No Exit, and The Age of Reason--philosophy, fiction, and drama dedicated to the absurdity of life, as well as to the necessity for freedom and for making choices. The letters slow down when Sartre returns to Occupied Paris and reunites with Beauvoir, and they stop in 1963 because, as Beauvoir explains in a footnote, after that year, in order to communicate with each other, the two always used the telephone. Without Beauvoir's responses, the letters reveal the trivial and commonplace preoccupations of even the most heroic of intellects in the most trying of times. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Technology companies invest billions in developing new gadgets; business leaders see innovation as the key to a competitive edge; policymakers craft regulations to foster a climate of innovation. And yet businesses report a success rate of only four percent for innovation initiatives. Can we significantly increase our odds of success? In <i>The Innovator's Way</i>, innovation experts Peter Denning and Robert Dunham reply with an emphatic yes. Innovation, they write, is not simply an invention, a policy, or a process to be managed. It is a personal skill that can be learned, developed through practice, and extended into organizations. Denning and Dunham identify and describe eight personal practices that all successful innovators perform: sensing, envisioning, offering, adopting, sustaining, executing, leading, and embodying. Together, these practices can boost a fledgling innovator to success. Weakness in any of these practices, they show, blocks innovation. Denning and Dunham chart the path to innovation mastery, from individual practices to teams and social networks. </p></p><p>Peter J. Denning is Distinguished Professor, Chair of the Computer Science Department, and Director of the Cebrowski Institute for Information Innovation and Superiority at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

Their approach is fresh and revolutionary. Their eight practices are practical, wise, and usher in a new and much-needed perspective on the how of innovation. Standing on solid research and experience this book transcends theory and takes you to the practices that allow innovation to flower. The Innovator's Way belongs on every leader's desk." Richard Strozzi-Heckler, author of The Leadership Dojo</p><br><br><p>"Denning and Dunham have taken innovation out of the realm of mysterious abilities into a very concrete set of practices.

Fortunately, sensible alternatives to this approach do exist, and methods of developing land while at the same time conserving natural areas are available.</p><p>In <i>Conservation Design for Subdivisions</i>, Randall G. Arendt explores better ways of designing new residential developments than we have typically seen in our communities. He presents a practical handbook for residential developers, site designers, local officials, and landowners that explains how to implement new ideas about land-use planning and environmental protection. Abundantly illustrated with site plans (many of them in color), floor plans, photographs, and renditions of houses and landscapes, it describes a series of simple and straightforward techniques that allows for land-conserving development.</p><p>The author proposes a step-by-step approach to conserving natural areas by rearranging density on each development parcel as it is being planned so that only half (or less) of the buildable land is turned into houselots and streets. Homes are built in a less land-consumptive manner that allows the balance of property to be permanently protected and added to an interconnected network of green spaces and green corridors. Included in the volume are model zoning and subdivision ordinance provisions that can help citizens and local officials implement these innovative design ideas.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>In Conservation Design for Subdivisions, Randall G.

Marriage, however, fails to live up to her expectations, which are fueled by sentimental novels, and she turns disastrously to love affairs. The story of Emma&#x2019;s adultery scandalized France when <i>Madame Bovary</i> was first published.&nbsp;Today, the heartbreaking story of Emma&#x2019;s financial ruin remains just as compelling.<br><br>In <i>Madame Bovary</i>, his story of a shallow, deluded, unfaithful, but consistently compelling woman living in the provinces of nineteenth-century France, Gustave Flaubert invented not only the modern novel but also a modern attitude toward human character and human experience that remains with us to this day. <br><br>One of the rare works of art that it would be fair to call perfect, <i>Madame Bovary</i> has had an incalculable influence on the literary culture that followed it. This translation, by Francis Steegmuller, is acknowledged by common consensus as the definitive English rendition of Flaubert&#x2019;s text.</p></p><p>This exquisite novel tells the story of one of the most compelling heroines in modern literature--Emma Bovary. Unhappily married to a devoted, clumsy provincial doctor, Emma revolts against the ordinariness of her life by pursuing voluptuous dreams of ecstasy and love. But her sensuous and sentimental desires lead her only to suffering corruption and downfall. A brilliant psychological portrait, <i>Madame Bovary</i> searingly depicts the human mind in search of transcendence. Who is Madame Bovary? Flaubert's answer to this question was superb: "Madame Bovary, c'est moi." Acclaimed as a masterpiece upon its publication in 1857, the work catapulted Flaubert to the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. This volume, with its fine translation by Lowell Bair, a perceptive introduction by Leo Bersani, and a complete supplement of essays and critical comments, is the indispensable <i>Madame Bovary</i>.The year 1857 propelled Flaubert into the law courts and into celebrity. It was not exactly the kind of celebrity he had wished for. &#39;Madame Bovary&#39; had appeared serially in &#39;La Revue de Paris&#39;. Now the imperial prosecutor was attacking the work for being offensive to religion and morality. Not only the seduction scenes, but the episodes dealing with religion and the description of Emma&#39;s death, came under direct censure. More than the subject, the general tone of the novel was denounced as immoral: the pervasive eroticism, the poetry of adultery, the so-called &#39;realism&#39; of the style. Flaubert, excellently defended by his lawyer, was acquitted.

With characteristic love for mystification, he presents the work as a bundle of documents fallen by chance into the hands of "Hilarius Bookbinder," who prepared them for printing. The book begins with a banquet scene patterned on Plato's Symposium. (George Brandes maintained that "one must recognize with amazement that it holds its own in this comparison.") Next is a discourse by "Judge William" in praise of marriage "in answer to objections." The remainder of the volume, almost two-thirds of the whole, is the diary of a young man, discovered by "Frater Taciturnus," who was deeply in love but felt compelled to break his engagement. The work closes with a letter to the reader from Taciturnus on the three "existence-spheres" represented by the three parts of the book.</p><br><br><p> <i>Stages on Life's Way</i> not only repeats themes, characters, and pseudonymous authors of the earlier works but also goes beyond them and points to further development of central ideas in <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript.</i><br> ?</p></p><p>Stages on Life&#39;s Way, the sequel to Either / Or, is an intensely poetic example of Kierkegaard&#39;s vision of the three stages, or spheres, of existence: the esthetic, the ethical, and the religious.Text: English, Danish (translation)</p><h2>Cosmic Connections (Mysteries of the Unknown)</h2><p>Explores man&#39;s earliest fascination with astronomy and the growth of astrology and discusses mysterious events throughout the world believed to have been foretold or affected by the positions of the stars</p><p></p><h2>The Irwin Guide to Using the Wall Street Journal</h2><p><p><b>The bestselling guidebook to the world's most trusted newspaper, now fully revised and updated</b></p> <p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> has long been an essential daily business resource, and since 1984, <i>The Irwin Guide to Using the </i>Wall Street Journal has helped professionals understand and get full value from the paper's detailed, up-to-the-minute information. The book's clear explanations and illustrations have helped more than a quarter million readers skillfully use the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> to identify market-moving events, track business cycles, find facts and figures, get before-the-bell access to vital information, and more.</p> <p>Dramatic changes in both the global business arena and the <i>Journal</i> itself have led to the need for a revised and updated guide. The seventh edition features:</p> <ul> <li>Six new chapters, along with hundreds of allnew graphs, charts, and examples straight from the pages of <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i> </li><li>New screen shots from the paper's increasingly popular online edition </li><li>Instant-access Web links to important government and industry sites </li></ul></p><p>It's quaint that in this day of search engines to help us find more search engines, some old-fashioned reference books are still perennial sellers. When <i>The Irwin Guide to Using</i> The Wall Street Journal premiered in 1984, the future day traders of the world weren't trading much more than Atari cartridges. So, the advent of this sixth edition--penned, as ever, by Michael B. Lehmann, a University of San Francisco economics professor who has developed a popular seminar class around it--receives a round of well-deserved kudos. <p> Even if, that is, its title remains a bit of a misnomer. For this is not, nor has ever it been, so much a guide to using the <i>WSJ</i>as it is a tidy primer on the fundamental workings of the U.S. economy and stock markets, intended not just to help readers enjoy the <i>WSJ</i> more, but to help them more fully comprehend what they read there. Lehmann covers just about everything, like a rigorous-but-not-draconian year of Economics 101: from how and why interest rates affect markets and when to expect the next recession to the Federal Reserve's impact on your investment portfolio and which fixed-income market is right for you. The guided tour Lehmann gives is well organized and accessible to the average financial layperson who can handle sentences slightly longer than those in <i>USA Today</i> and doesn't think "Federal Reserve" refers to an early 19th-century architectural style. A certain amount of patience may be called for, too: though no opaque academic text, <i>The Irwin Guide</i> is far from one of those Dummies/Idiots books that somehow crams the greatest matters of civilization into what generally look like coloring books for adults. Lehmann's text is dense, relieved only occasionally by various charts or articles previously published in the <i>WSJ</i>. Curious is the near-total absence of terms you would have expected to see in an update from the 1996 edition--terms like "Internet," "dot-com," and "WWW." But after six editions you have to think that Lehmann's a sly one--maybe he speaks most eloquently of how the current dot-com/IPO mania will play in the long term by saying absolutely nothing. --<i>Timothy Murphy</i></p><p><b>How to improve your investment performance with <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>--with online research strategies specifically designed for WSJ.com!</b></p> <p>Each business day, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> delivers an unmatched array of information and charts on what exactly is happening in the U.S. economy and markets.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the <strong>Global Music Series</strong>. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> <em>Music in West Africa</em> presents fundamental style concepts of West African music using a focused case study of performance in Liberia, West Africa, among the Kpelle people. The book discusses the diversity, motifs, and structure of West African music within the larger patterns of the region's culture, highlighting those aspects of Kpelle music that are common to many other West African traditions. It also describes how music and dance in West Africa are tied to the fabric of everyday social and political life. <br> Kpelle musicians value musical performance where multiple performers each contribute aspects of sound that fit together in elaborate ways. Drawing upon her extensive fieldwork and research, author Ruth Stone--who was raised in the Bong County region of Liberia--centers on key stylistic elements that Kpelle performers articulate and emphasize: faceting or breaking music into smaller parts, layering tone colors, part-counterpart relationships in musical structures, and time and polyrhythm. She explores fascinating parallels to these analytic themes in the textiles and masks of related arts and in broader cultural practices such as greeting sequences. <br> <em>Music in West Africa</em> is enhanced by eyewitness accounts of local performances, interviews with key performers, and vivid illustrations. Packaged with a 70-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed in the book, it features guided listening and hands-on activities that encourage readers to engage actively and critically with the music.<br></p><p>Ruth M.

Among classical texts this correspondence is unparalleled; nowhere else do we get such an intimate look at the life of a prominent Roman and his social world, or such a vivid sense of a momentous period in Roman history.</p><p>The 435 letters collected here represent Cicero's correspondence with friends and acquaintances over a period of 20 years, from 62 BCE, when Cicero's political career was at its peak, to 43 BCE, the year he was put to death by the victorious Triumvirs. They range widely in substance and style, from official dispatches and semi-public letters of political importance to casual notes that chat with close friends about travels and projects, domestic pleasures and books, and questions currently debated. This new Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Letters to Friends</i>, in three volumes, brings together D. R. Shackleton Bailey's standard Latin text, now updated, and a revised version of his much admired translation first published by Penguin. This authoritative edition complements the new Loeb edition of Cicero's <i>Letters to Atticus</i>, also translated by Shackleton Bailey.</p></p><p><p>D. R.

Original. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>Although the sheer size of this dense workbook might cause initial hyperventilation--280 full-size sheets of text--take heart (and a deep breath!): the many self-assessment tools and calming techniques presented in this fifth edition can help overcome anxiety and promote physical and emotional well-being. First introduced in 1980, the book received praise for presenting a comprehensive look at stress, its physical manifestations, and the multiple ways it can be managed. Twenty years later, its well-organized chapters on breathing, relaxation, meditation, thought stopping, and body awareness still guide the reader through copious self-help techniques to try and, eventually, master. Other chapters, including job stress management, goal setting and time management, and assertiveness training, focus on daily scenarios people often find distressing. Lessons in identifying key elements that trigger unpleasant responses and in reacting differently to these elements are designed to defuse perceived conflicts. For this edition, coauthors Martha Davis (psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry of Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Santa Clara, CA), Elizabeth Robbins Eshelman (licensed clinical social worker with Kaiser Permanente Online), and Matthew McKay (clinical director of Haight-Ashbury Psychological Services, San Francisco, CA) have added topics on worry control, anger management, and eye-movement therapy. New diagrams and a more reader-friendly format should appeal to readers, despite a few typos and graphical mishaps. This is a valuable tool for therapists, their patients, and the stressed-at-large. <i>--Liane Thomas</i>Updated with a bold new look, this best-selling classic workbook for beating stress offers comprehensive, step-by-step directions for the most popular relaxation techniques including mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, thought stopping, stress inoculation, autogenics, and more.</p><h2>German: How to Speak and Write It (Beginners&#39; Guides)</h2><p>Ideal as an introduction, supplement, or refresher.

In over 1200 alphabetically arranged entries, <em>The Oxford Companion to the Body</em> covers every aspect of human anatomy as well as related topics that range from Aggression, Aspirin, and Anxiety, to Warts, Whistling, Yoga, and X-Rays.<br> Attractively designed with over 400 illustrations--including 15 full-color plates focusing on human physiology--this engrossing Companion shows how the body works, how it grows, develops, and ages, how it goes wrong, and even how it has inspired artists through the centuries. There are profiles of historical figures who have made important contributions to our understanding of the body, such as Galen, Vesalius, and da Vinci. There are also concise and readable accounts of the structures of all major systems of the body, their processes, and the diseases that affect them, from the nervous system to the skeleton to the brain. But one of the pleasures of the book is the many unexpected entries to come across: Body Language and Brain Death, Freckles and Frostbite, Potty Training and Phantom Limbs, Sleep Disorders and Survival at Sea. The volume also boasts general essays that describe how the body is seen in Zen Buddhism, Islam, mythology, and other disciplines. <br> Written by over 250 experts, under the guidance of a distinguished editorial board, with full cross-referencing and suggested further reading, <em>The Oxford Companion to the Body</em> is both an authoritative resource and a browser's delight.</p><p><br><strong>Colin Blakemore</strong> is Professor of Physiology at the University of Oxford, and Director of the McDonnell-Pew Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Oxford.

Editors Blakemore and Jennett are physiology professors at Oxford and the University of Glasgow, respectively, and British spelling is used throughout. Many entries provide See also references, and longer entries include suggestions for further reading. There is also a comprehensive index. Illustrations, including line drawings, black-and-white photographs, and full-color plates, are used conservatively, and some entries, such as "Surgery," could have been enhanced by the inclusion of some sort of illustration. However, the editors have succeeded admirably in their goal of providing a "seamless blending of science and humanities." Entries range from major religions and how each views the body (e.g. "Hinduism and the Body," a two-page article) to many parts of the body ("Fallopian Tubes" merits a brief paragraph as well as See also references, and while neither fingers nor toes warrants an entry, "Fingerprints" does). There are entries for professions that specialize in the use of the body ("Model, Artist's," with the requisite nude photograph) and even for concepts, like "Leisure," with See also references to "Relaxation" and "Sport." "Mandrake Root" is listed because it resembles a person and is beautifully illustrated by a reproduction from Dioscorides's Materia medica. Remarkably affordable and compulsively readable, this volume will find a home in any academic or public library's history of medicine or reference collection. Martha E.

Among his fascinating findings is the work of amygdala structure within the brain. The amygdala mediates fear and other responses and actually processes information more quickly than other parts of the brain, allowing a rapid response that can save our lives before other parts of the brain have had a chance to react. He also offers findings and theories on how the brain handles--and in many cases, buries--extremely traumatic experiences.

How freely can the reader interpret it? Could a nursery rhyme like <i>Baa Baa Black Sheep</i> be full of concealed loathing, resentment, and aggression?

The first 100,000 copies printed of its Russian translation sold out the day they appeared in Moscow bookstores. This magnificently written novel about a double conjugal failure is imbued with subtle yet profound psychological insights of a caliber that arguably rivals Tolstoy's. Here Phillipe Marcenat, an erudite yet conventional industrialist from central France, falls madly in love with and marries the beautiful but unreliable Odile despite his family's disapproval. Soon, Phillipe's possessiveness and jealousy drive her away. Brokenhearted, Phillipe then marries the devoted and sincere Isabelle and promptly inflicts on his new wife the very same woes he endured at the hands of Odile. But Isabelle's integrity and determination to save her marriage adds yet another dimension to this extraordinary work on the dynamics and vicissitudes of love.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2012</strong>: Imagine (remember?) being a 14-year-old obsessed with understanding romantic love. You would have swooned for <i>Climates</i>, a beloved 1928 French best seller, newly translated. A novel about two marriages--one in which an insecure man drives away his ethereal (and probably crazy) wife, the other in which the same man subjects his loyal new wife to the kind of emotional torture he previously endured--it&#x2019;s a kind of old-fashioned parable full of dramatic prose. (The beginning of the marital breakdown is described as &#x201c;a fine crack [sent] through the transparent crystal of my love.&#x201d;) But don&#x2019;t dismiss this delightful novel by &#x201c;Andr� Maurois,&#x201d; the pseudonym for French historian �mile Herzog, as simply camp; it is strangely wise about a specific culture and time, as well as about the universal affairs of the heart. --<i>Sara Nelson</i><b>Andr� Maurois </b>(1885&#x2013;1967), born Emile Herzog, was a writer of considerable versatility who achieved success as a biographer, historian, and novelist.

With this much-needed introduction to the UN, Jussi Hanhim�ki engages the current debate over the organizations effectiveness as he provides a clear understanding of how it was originally conceived, how it has come to its present form, and how it must confront new challenges in a rapidly changing world.<br><br>After a brief history of the United Nations and its predecessor, the League of Nations, the author examines the UN's successes and failures as a guardian of international peace and security, as a promoter of human rights, as a protector of international law, and as an engineer of socio-economic development. Hanhim�ki stresses that the UN's greatest problem has been the impossibly wide gap between its ambitions and capabilities. In the area of international security, for instance, the UN has to settle conflicts--be they between or within states--without offending the national sovereignty of its member states, and without being sidelined by strong countries, as happened in the 2003 intervention of Iraq. Hanhim�ki also provides a clear accounting of the UN and its various arms and organizations (such as UNESCO and UNICEF), and he offers a critical overview of how effective it has been in the recent crises in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, for example--and how likely it is to meet its overall goals in the future.<br><br>The United Nations, Hanhim�ki concludes, is an indispensable organization that has made the world a better place. But it is also a deeply flawed institution, in need of constant reform.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

The Dalai Lama has gained broad international sympathy in his appeals for autonomy from China, yet the Chinese government maintains a hard-line position against it. What is the history of the conflict? Can the two sides come to an acceptable compromise? In this thoughtful analysis, distinguished professor and longtime Tibet analyst Melvyn C. Goldstein presents a balanced and accessible view of the conflict and a proposal for the future.<br><br>Tibet's political fortunes have undergone numerous vicissitudes since the fifth Dalai Lama first ascended to political power in Tibet in 1642. In this century, a forty-year period of de facto independence following the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911 ended abruptly when the Chinese Communists forcibly incorporated Tibet into their new state and began the series of changes that destroyed much of Tibet's traditional social, cultural, and economic system. After the death of Mao in 1976, the rise to power of Deng Xiaoping quickly produced a change in attitude in Beijing and a major initiative to negotiate with the Dalai Lama to solve the conflict. This failed. With the death of Deng Xiaoping, the future of Tibet is more uncertain than ever, and Goldstein argues that the conflict could easily erupt into violence.<br><br>Drawing upon his deep knowledge of the Tibetan culture and people, Goldstein takes us through the history of Tibet, concentrating on the political and cultural negotiations over the status of Tibet from the turn of the century to the present. He describes the role of Tibet in Chinese politics, the feeble and conflicting responses of foreign governments, overtures and rebuffs on both sides, and the nationalistic emotions that are inextricably entwined in the political debate. Ultimately, he presents a plan for a reasoned compromise, identifying key aspects of the conflict and appealing to the United States to play an active diplomatic role. Clearly written and carefully argued, this book will become the definitive source for anyone seeking an understanding of the Tibet Question during this dangerous turning point in its turbulent history.</p><p>Just the facts, Ma'am. Wouldn't it be nice if we could simply inspect the historical record and resolve the question of whether or not Tibet has traditionally been a part of China? Melvyn Goldstein, anthropologist and Tibet specialist, takes us in that direction in <i>The Snow Lion and the Dragon</i>. <p> The results? Not so fast. Like a scientist analyzing experimental data, Goldstein walks us through centuries of unending political struggle and battles of conquest. He shows us that Tibet first came under Chinese suzerainty during the Mongolian era and then for almost 300 years during the Manchu era. For the most part, <i>The Snow Lion and the Dragon</i> succeeds as chronicle of the power plays of two governments vying for control of Tibet.</p><p> But when Goldstein speaks of the Chinese government, what does he mean by "Chinese"? Does he mean the Mongols when they controlled the territory we call China and the Manchus when they did? Were these legitimate Chinese governments? </p><p> Although Goldstein is sincere in his objective methods, many questions such as these lurk behind the illusion objectivity. Ultimately, history is interpretation, and without admitting this, Goldstein lures the reader into a false sense of complacency. </p><p> <i>The Snow Lion and the Dragon</i> is a helpful historical summary for anyone who wonders how the Tibet Question has played itself out from the beginning up until 1997, but for an adequate examination of historical subtleties surrounding the issue, we must continue to wait. --<i>Brian Bruya</i></p>"A marvelously informative and realistic look at both how China and Tibet reached their present impasse and how their differences might yet be peacefully resolved. By providing much crucial background material about this fractious problem, it becomes essential reading for anyone who cares about Tibet's future."&#x2015;Orville Schell, author of <i>Mandate of Heaven</i><br><br>"Mel Goldstein has dedicated his life to the study of Tibet.

Graham and his circle, which included Stuart Davis, Arshile Gorky, and Willem de Kooning, helped redefine ideas of what painting and sculpture could be. They, along with others in Graham's orbit, such as Jackson Pollock and David Smith, played a critical role in developing and defining American modernism. <i>American Vanguards</i> showcases about eighty-seven works of art from this vital period that demonstrate the interconnections, common sources, and shared stimuli among the members of Graham's circle.</p><p>Three essays by notable scholars investigate the complex relationships among Graham and his New York artist-colleagues during this formative period. William C. Agee positions Graham and his circle within the movement of New Classicism, which drew upon classical and Renaissance examples in an attempt to overcome the devastation of World War I. Irving Sandler focuses on the social, political, and intellectual dynamics among Davis, Gorky, Graham, and de Kooning in the mid-1930s. Karen Wilkin discusses the circumstances that brought these artists together, their common commitment to modernism, and the fascinating artistic cross-fertilization evident in their work. This critical reconsideration sheds new light on the New York School, Abstract Expressionism, and the vitality of American modernism between the two world wars.</p></p><p><b>William C.

First published in 1870, this treasury of 'words that have a tale to tell has established itself as one of the great reference classics-the first port of call for tens of thousands of terms, phrases and proper names, and a fund of fascinating, unusual and out-of-the-way information.</p><p>At the heart of the dictionary lie entries on the meaning and origin of a vast range of words and expressions, from everyday phrases to Latin tags. Alongside these are articles on people and events in mythology and religion, and on folk customs, superstitions and beliefs. Major events and people in history are also treated, as are movements in art and literature, famous literary characters, and key aspects of popular culture, philosophy, geography, science and magic. To complete this rich mix of information, Brewer and his subsequent editors have added an extraordinary and enticing miscellany of general knowledge-lists of patron saints, terms in heraldry, regimental nicknames, public house names, and famous last words.</p><p>For the sixteenth edition of Brewer's the entire existing text has been revised and updated and over 1000 new articles added. These include:</p><li>recent expressions (the full monty, couch</li><li>potato, bit the ground running, Montezuma's revenge)</li><li>recent events and organizations (Black Wednesday, Taliban)</li><li>famous nicknames (Fab Four)</li><li>historical and fictional characters (Attila the Hun, Anne Frank).<p>Brand-new articles on hurricane names, celebrated place-names in literature, and frequently mispronounced words continue the century-old Brewer's practice of recording unexpected and fascinating information that is not available in other general reference books.</p></li></p><p><p>Dr. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, the son of a Norwich schoolmaster, was born in 1810. He graduated in Law from Cambridge in 1836 and two years later was ordained, before returning to teach at his father's school. There he compiled his first major work, A Guide to Science. It proved immensely popular, perhaps funding the extensive European travels he subsequently undertook.</p><p>Returning to England in 1856, he slowly put together the work that was to become Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. Much of the nucleus of the dictionary derived from correspondence with readers of his earlier works, beginning a tradition of readers' involvement with the new book that continues today. The first edition was published by Cassell in 1870 and sold over 100,000 copies. In 1894 Brewer compiled a completely revised and substantially enlarged edition. He lived for another three years, long enough to see sales of the revised edition 'far exceed our utmost expectations'.<br><br></p><p>Adrian Room, who has revised the Sixteenth Edition of Brewer's, is the author of over fifty popular reference books, mainly on the origins of words, and, in particular, names. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the English Place-Name Society and American Name Society. He was a Senior Lecturer in Russian with the Ministry of Defence until 1984, when he took up full-time writing.</p>This entry advances the Thorndike-Barnhart^B line into the serious-looking dictionary that adults will recognize. Line drawings and small black-and-white photos replace the color illustrations found in the junior books. Definitions still include example sentences but are more complex and use a higher range of vocabulary. There are more personal names from history and fewer from popular culture than can be found in the <i>Thorndike-Barnhart Junior Dictionary</i> . There are also fewer boxed features, and those that remain ("Word Source," "Word Family") tend to be more detailed. A style manual takes into account the older, more sophisticated user. Test words are well defined; <i>set </i> and <i>take</i> include more than 15 definitions each. Another look at... Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and FableOne of the defining characteristics of an enduring reference source is the stamp of personality. <i>Famous First Facts </i> and <i>Baker's </i> Biographical Dictionary of Musicians wouldn't be the same without Joseph Nathan Kane and Nicolas Slonimsky. Another work that owes much to an attentive and even obsessive compiler is <i>Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. </i> Mid-Victorian British publisher John Cassell wanted to supply his working-class readers with material both entertaining and improving, and Dr. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer was just the person for the job. Their partnership resulted in numerous popular works, among them the famous dictionary, which was first published in 1870. The preface to the first edition described it as an "alms-basket of words," that "draws in curious or novel etymologies, pseudonyms and popular titles, local traditions and literary blunders, biographical and historical trifles too insignificant to find a place of higher pretension, but not too worthless to be worth knowing." Brewer, who was born in 1810, claimed that the dictionary evolved from his boyhood habit of note taking. Around 1841, while still a Norwich schoolmaster, he wrote a popular compendium called <i>Guide to Science, </i> which "brought me in a large number of questions on all imaginary matters." These questions and their answers formed the basis for the dictionary, so successful that the first edition was reprinted 18 times. It was designed to meet the needs of a new class of readers who did not have the advantage of a classical education. It also exemplified that impulse toward collecting and classifying that seemed to distinguish so much Victorian scholarship. The Victorian flavor was retained through many editions. In fact, as reviewers have pointed out, there was not much difference between the first edition and the fourteenth, published in 1989. Beginning with the fifteenth edition, revisions have been in the hands of Adrian Room, himself a prodigious compiler of facts, being the author of <i>Dictionary of First Names </i> (Cassell, 1995), <i>A Dictionary of Pseudonyms </i> and Their Origins (McFarland, 1997), and <i>Placenames of the World </i> (McFarland, 1997), among many other titles. In the preface to the newest edition of <i>Brewer's, </i> Room states that there are "changes on four fronts." One of these changes is the addition of 1,000 new entries. These range from older words and phrases that appear here for the first time (<i>hysteria, I Ching</i> )<i> </i> to terms of more recent vintage (<i>blockbuster, dress down </i> [as in dress-down Fridays], <i>main squeeze, millennium bug</i> ).<i> </i> There are more subentries, such as <i>down time </i> listed under <i>down. </i> Many of these new subentries actually refer the reader to main entry headings (<i>Hulk, the Incredible, </i> see under Incredible), and the much greater number of <i>see </i> references is the most obvious difference between this edition and the last. The third change is the addition of new quotations. The fourth is that some entries have been dropped. Although most of the missing are arcane terms, there is plenty left to delight the lover of the odd and obscure. In what other single volume will you find, for example, a list of the 50 Nereids listed in Edmund Spenser's <i>The </i> Faerie Queen; descriptions of famous <i>Fakes, </i> from Piltdown Man to the Hitler diaries; and almost five pages of <i>Famous last words</i> ? Not to mention patron saints and saints' symbols, the 12 oldest British public schools for girls, and British public house signs? The last two examples remind us that the book still has a very British emphasis. This emphasis helps account for some of the errors (e.g., the Chicago Bears is "a record-breaking American football team, with a home base at Wrigley Field") that continue to make their way from one edition into the next. Despite the revisions, libraries that already hold the fifteenth edition of <i>Brewer's </i> may not need to change. Updating information and rectifying omissions, two of the most compelling reasons for trading in an edition that is only a few year old for a newer model, are not major considerations in this case. Meanwhile, a full hypertext version is available on the Web, generally bundled with other titles as part of a basic reference collection (for example, at <i>Bib</i> liomania [http://www.bibliomania.com]). This is the 1894 revision, however--how many students browsing its contents will know (or care) that editions far newer and more useful for research may sit on the reference shelves nearby? That said, we feel sure that Dr. Brewer, with his fascination for stray facts, would feel right at home on the Internet, the ultimate miscellany. REVWR<br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this stylish and insightful book, intended for both general readers and students, James Romm argues that the author of the <i>Histories</i> was both a historian&#x2015;in the original sense of "one who inquires"&#x2015;and a master storyteller.<br><br>Although most ancient historians wrote only about events they themselves had lived through, Herodotus explored an era well before his own time&#x2015;from the rise of the Persian Empire to the Persian invasions of Greece in 490 and 480 B.C., the heroic fight of the Greeks against the invaders, and the final Greek victory. Working without the aid of written sources, Herodotus traveled widely and wove into his chronology descriptions of people and countries he visited and anecdotes that shed light on their lives and customs. Romm discusses the historical background of Herodotus`s life and work, his moralistic approach to history, his insatiable fascination with people and places, his literary powers, and the question of the historical "truth" behind the stories he relates. He gives general readers a fresh appreciation of the <i>Histories</i> as a work encompassing fiction and nonfiction, myth and history, and poetry and prose. Herodotus becomes not simply a source of historical data but a masterful and artistic author who created a radically new literary genre.<br><br>Hermes Books<br>John Herington, Founding Editor<br></p><p>[Romm] explores succinctly Herodotus' double roles as an historian and a spinner of yarns (it's sometimes hard to tell when one begins and the other leaves off), and he makes it clear that the ancient world was populated by folks who could be as duplicitous or heroic as any alive today. -- <i>Herbert Kupferberg, Parade</i></p><h2>The Dunwich Horror</h2><p>A classic tale of terror and grotesquerie by the original master of horror<br><br>H. P. Lovecraft proclaimed his <i>Dunwich Horror</i> "so fiendish" that his editor at <i>Weird Tales</i> "may not dare to print it." The editor, fortunately, knew a good thing when he saw it.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the core Cthulhu stories, <i>The Dunwich Horror</i> introduces us to the grim village of Dunwich, where each member of the Whateley family is more grotesque than the other. There's the grandfather, a mad old sorcerer; Lavinia, the deformed, albino woman; and Wilbur, a disgusting specimen who reaches full manhood in less than a decade. And above all, there's the mysterious presence in the farmhouse, unseen but horrifying, which seems to be growing . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> Wilbur tracks down an original edition of the Necronomicon and breaks into a library to steal it. But his reward eludes him: he gets caught, and the result is death by guard dog. Meanwhile, left unattended, the monster at the Whateley house keeps expanding, until the farmhouse explodes and the beast is unleashed to terrorize the poor, aggrieved village of Dunwich. <br> &nbsp;<br> As chilling today as it was upon its publication in 1929, <i>The Dunwich Horror</i> is a horrifying masterwork by the man Stephen King called "the twentieth century's greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale."</p><p><b>H.P.

How can we create a future in which revenge is less common and forgiveness is more common?

Drawing on exciting breakthroughs from the social and biological sciences, McCullough dispenses surprising and practical advice for making the world a more forgiving place. <p>Michael E. McCullough (Miami, Florida), an internationally recognized expert on forgiveness and revenge, is a professor of psychology at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where he directs the Laboratory for Social and Clinical Psychology.</p></p><p><p>Praise for Beyond Revenge</p> <p>"It is not easy to want to forgive, rather than avenge, a wrong.

Why is forgiveness so difficult?</p> <p>What must we do to create a less vengeful, more forgiving world?</p> <p>These perennial questions have never been more relevant than they are today. Psychologist Michael E. McCullough tackles them by challenging centuries-old misconceptions about revenge and forgiveness. Contrary to conventional wisdom, McCullough contends that the desire for revenge should not be likened to a "disease" or a "poison" that makes people do terrible things to each other. Instead, he argues, natural selection created our penchant for revenge because it helped our ancestors solve social dilemmas they encountered during human evolution. Revenge, according to McCullough, is a "problem" for us today because it was a "solution" during our ancestral past.</p> <p>McCullough also debunks the misconception that forgiveness should be likened to an "antidote" or a "cure" for the desire for revenge. Instead, he argues, humans' capacity to forgive evolved because it helped our ancestors preserve relationships with genetic relatives and other valuable relationship partners. McCullough goes on to argue that when we encounter the social circumstances that activated the "forgiveness instinct" in the ancestral past, modern-day humans will be naturally inclined to forgive, often with less effort than we usually assume.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking book, McCullough shows that the key to a more forgiving, less vengeful world is to understand the evolutionary forces that gave rise to these intimately human traits, the social forces that activate them in human minds today, and the changes that are necessary to make our relationships and social institutions better at activating the forgiveness instinct. Drawing on exciting breakthroughs from the social and biological sciences, McCullough dispenses surprising and practical advice for making the world a more forgiving place.</p></p><h2>The Little Book of Self-Care for Aquarius: Simple Ways to Refresh and Restore&#x2015;According to the Stars (Astrology Self-Care)</h2><p><b>Everything you need to know about self-care&#x2014;especially for Aquarius! </b><br><br>Take Time for You, Aquarius!<br> <br>It&#x2019;s me time&#x2014;powered by the zodiac!

F. Stone</h2><p>Izzy Stone was a reporter, a radical, an idealist, a scholar and, it is clear, a writer whose insights have more than stood the test of time. More than fifteen years after his death, this collection of his work from <i>I.F. Stone's Weekly</i> and elsewhere is astonishing in its relevance to our age, addressing the clash between national security and individual liberty, the protection of minorities, economic fairness, social justice, and the American military abroad.<p> The core of Stone's genius was his newsletter, I.F. Stone's Weekly, published from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s. His meticulous dissection of the news was unsurpassed, a direct descendent of the great pamphleteers like Thomas Paine, and a forerunner to the best of today's political blogs. Stone's brilliant, investigative reporting; his wonderful, impassioned style; and his commitment to his values all make this collection an inspiration, and a revelation.</p></p><p><b>I.F. (Izzy) Stone</b> (1907&#x2013;1989) had a remarkable journalistic career, as an editorialist at the <i>New York Post</i> during the Great Depression, a longtime staffer at <i>The Nation</i> , the author of many books, and the founder and editor of his own <i>I.F. Stone's Weekly</i> , he "spoke truth to power" with an effectiveness that few have done before or since.When I. F. Stone died in 1989, it seemed reasonable to assume that his investigative reporting, columns, and editorials would soon be forgotten, as is the case with most journalism. But the words published in <i>I. F. Stone's Weekly</i>, a unique newsletter about national and international politics published from 1953 to 1971, have not faded from the record, and resonate today. Weber has chosen wisely from the newsletter and Stone's freelance pieces for the <i>Nation</i>and the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, and Peter Osnos, founder of PublicAffairs press and a former editorial assistant to Stone, has written a lively, loving introduction to the always erudite and passionate, sometimes irascible, hard-digging reporter. Osnos is not exaggerating when he stresses the relevance of Stone's journalism today, and that is uplifting. Indeed, a great journalist guarding the public interest is cause for celebration in any era. But it is also profoundly depressing because so little has changed within the U.S. government and in the world's trouble spots since Stone was on the case.

Thomas J. Christensen argues against this zero-sum vision. Instead, he describes a new paradigm in which the real challenge lies in dissuading China from regional aggression while encouraging the country to contribute to the global order. Drawing on decades of scholarship and experience as a senior diplomat, Christensen offers a compelling new assessment of U.S.-China relations that is essential reading for anyone interested in the future of the globalized world.</p><p><em>The China Challenge</em> shows why China is nowhere near powerful enough to be considered a global &#x201c;peer competitor&#x201d; of the United States, but it is already strong enough to destabilize East Asia and to influence economic and political affairs worldwide. Despite China&#x2019;s impressive achievements, the Chinese Communist Party faces enormous challenges. Christensen shows how nationalism and the threat of domestic instability influence the party&#x2019;s decisions on issues like maritime sovereignty disputes, global financial management, control of the Internet, climate change, and policies toward Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p><p>China benefits enormously from the current global order and has no intention of overthrowing it; but that is not enough. China&#x2019;s active cooperation is essential to global governance. Never before has a developing country like China been asked to contribute so much to ensure international stability. If China obstructs international efforts to confront nuclear proliferation, civil conflicts, financial instability, and climate change, those efforts will falter, but even if China merely declines to support such efforts, the problems will grow vastly more complicated.</p><p>Analyzing U.S.-China policy since the end of the Cold War, Christensen articulates a balanced strategic approach that explains why we should aim not to block China&#x2019;s rise but rather to help shape its choices so as to deter regional aggression and encourage China&#x2019;s active participation in international initiatives that benefit both nations.</p> 23 maps and charts</p><p>Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Thomas J.

Christensen is fluent in history but never captive to it. He aims not to prevent China's rise but to shape it with a mix of strength and moderation. Above all, he shows us how to avoid a conflict that he considers possible but, in no way, inevitable. He made a believer out of me.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Evan Osnos, National Book Award-winning author of <em>Age of Ambition</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is no one I would rather read on China than Tom Christensen. He has the rare ability to transcend the conventional either/or debates about China and to see the country simultaneously as a power with the potential to disrupt global politics in many negative ways&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;as a country that the United States must engage as a partner in solving global problems. He also has a deep and much needed understanding of how Chinese domestic politics shape Chinese foreign policy.

He explains skillfully why the United States needs an adroit combination of national strength, international partnerships, and cooperation with China. Christensen's aim: a search for mutual interests, both between the two countries and in support of regional and global systems.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert B. Zoellick, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The rise of China is one of the prime challenges for American foreign policy. Thomas Christensen uses his first rate credentials both as a scholar and a practitioner to give a clear and compelling answer to this challenge.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Harvard University, and former Assistant Secretary of Defense</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tom Christensen has written a book that displays the ideal mix of ''richness, rigor, and relevance.'' Countering naive neo-conservative and liberal interventionists who seem to think that threats to an adversary's vital interests are all you need to induce compliance, and naive rationalist liberals who believe economic and institutional engagement will largely contain revisionist preferences, Christensen shows from a careful empirical analysis of Chinese foreign policy how stable coexistence in US-China relations rests on a delicate balance of both deterrence and reassurance. Hopefully future US decision makers will read this book and absorb its message.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alastair Iain Johnston, Laine Professor of China in World Affairs, Harvard University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Christensen is one of the world&#x2019;s leading China experts, an experienced senior policymaker, and a top-notch international relations theorist. <em>The China Challenge</em> is outstanding, a must-read for anybody interested in China, American foreign policy, or global affairs more generally.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gideon Rose, editor, <em>Foreign Affairs</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Everything you need to know about the sometimes bewildering, always tricky issues generated by the rise of China is here in Tom Christensen's lucid book. China is something new in the world, a rising authoritarian state that is an economic colossus and very nearly a first-rate military power, which is what makes it the most important strategic challenge we''re going to face for the foreseeable future. Christensen doesn't promise that dealing with China will be easy. It won't be. But he is utterly clear-headed, realistic, persuasive, and, perhaps most important, cautiously optimistic, as he resets the terms of the continuing debate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Bernstein, author of <em>China 1945</em></strong></p><h2>The Machine Stops</h2><p>This is a science fiction story by Forster. The story describes a world in which most of the human population has lost the ability to live on the surface of the Earth. In 1973 it was included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame.

Focusing on remnant forest systems, it describes methods of restoring and linking forest fragments to recreate a whole landscape fabric.The book begins by explaining the history and current situation of forest ecosystems in the eastern United States. Following that is an in-depth examination of the restoration process, with thorough descriptions of ecological strategies for landscape management along with specific examples of how those strategies have been implemented in various sites around the country. The final section provides hands-on information about the many specific details that must be considered when initiating and implementing a restoration program. All aspects of the restoration process are considered, including: Water -- opportunities for increasing infiltration, reducing pollutants, promoting habitat values Ground -- methods of protecting existing vegetation, removing fill, rebuilding soils Plants -- strategies and procedures for planting, maintenance, propagation Wildlife -- guidelines for preserving wildlife resources, management techniques to favor selected specie.<i>The Once and Future Forest</i> presents a comprehensive approach to assessing sites, detailed guidelines for determining management goals, and a thorough overview of appropriate management and restoration techniques. It is an important guide for professional planners and landscape architects, government agency personnel at all levels, land managers, scientists involved in restoration work, and citizen activists who wish to do something constructive about our deteriorating forest patches.</p><p>Leslie Jones Sauer is principal and landscape architect with Andropogon Associates, Ltd., based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Biopsychology</h2><p>Used book</p><p>John Pinel, the author of Biopsychology, obtained his Ph.D. from McGill University in Montreal and worked briefly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before taking a faculty position at the University of British Columbia, where he is currently Professor Emeritus.

Dubious mermaids and wild men who resisted classification. Elegant sleight-of-hand artists who routinely exposed the secrets of their trade. These were some of the playful forms of fraud which astonished, titillated, and even outraged nineteenth-century America's new middle class, producing some of the most remarkable urban spectacles of the century.</p><p>In <i>The Arts of Deception</i>, James W. Cook explores this distinctly modern mode of trickery designed to puzzle the eye and challenge the brain. Championed by the "Prince of Humbug," P. T. Barnum, these cultural puzzles confused the line between reality and illusion. Upsetting the normally strict boundaries of value, race, class, and truth, the spectacles offer a revealing look at the tastes, concerns, and prejudices of America's very first mass audiences. We are brought into the exhibition halls, theaters, galleries, and museums where imposture flourished, and into the minds of the curiosity-seekers who eagerly debated the wonders before their eyes. Cook creates an original portrait of a culture in which ambiguous objects, images, and acts on display helped define a new value system for the expanding middle class, as it confronted a complex and confusing world.</p></p><p>James W.

(Jackson Lears <i>New Republic</i> 2001-11-12)<br><br>Cook explores the 19th-century Americans' fascination with fraud and deception as entertainment, and suggests that the popularity of what P. T. Barnum referred to as "humbugs" is intimately related to the birth of popular and mass culture in the 19th century and to other important features of a 19th-century, middle-class, market-driven society. Cook considers a wide and eclectic range of specific "curiosities"...This is a fun, intelligent, sophisticated, imaginative book. (K. Blaser <i>Choice</i> 2002-02-01)<br><br>Although readers may very well wonder whether there is anything more to be said about P. T. Barnum and 'humbuggery' in nineteenth-century America, this superb book provides a resounding affirmation. The research is impressive, the presentation is engaging and flows smoothly...[A] compelling book. (Michael Kammen <i>American Studies</i>)<br><br>James W. Cook's book on 'artful deceptions' in nineteenth-century American popular culture is not merely fascinating, fluently written, and engaging to read. It sheds light on a number of different subjects and helps us to appreciate the thoroughly interconnected nature of cultural phenomena in what he calls, quite appropriately, the 'age of Barnum.' Indeed, it is a stellar example of cultural history, providing the reader with both a vivid picture of the specific social milieu that encouraged this new mode of exhibition and an understanding of the more amorphous intellectual climate that influenced exhibitors and audiences alike. Making shrewd use of the available evidence, Cook has written a book filled with compelling stories and anecdotal details. Yet what stands out in the end is the rigor and incisiveness of his analysis--the provocative conclusions he derives from his vignettes and the remarkable way that he is able to make us see their larger significance...<i>The Arts of Deception</i> is an important work in the new historiography of popular culture.

Although widely popular in its time, the work in its entirety has been out of print since the early twentieth century. This volume returns <i>Sesame and Lilies </i>to<i> </i>easy availability and reunites the two halves of the work: <i>Of Kings&#x2019; Treasuries, </i>in which Ruskin critiques Victorian manhood, and <i>Of Queens&#x2019; Gardens, </i>in which he counsels women to take their places as the moral guides of men and urges the parents of girls to educate them to this end. <br><br>Feminist critics of the 1960s and 1970s regarded <i>Of Queens&#x2019; Gardens </i>as<i> </i>an exemplary expression of repressive Victorian ideas about femininity, and they paired it with John Stuart Mill&#x2019;s more progressive <i>Subjection of Women</i>.<i> </i>This volume, by including the often ignored <i>Of Kings&#x2019; Treasuries, </i>offers readers full access to Ruskin&#x2019;s complex and sometimes contradictory views on men and women. The accompanying essays place <i>Sesame and Lilies </i>within<i> </i>historical debates on men, women, culture, and the family. Elizabeth Helsinger examines the text as a meditation on the pleasures of reading, Seth Koven gives a wide-ranging account of how Victorians read <i>Sesame and Lilies, </i>and Jan Marsh situates the work within controversies over educational reform. <br></p><p>Rethinking the Western Tradition Series<b>Deborah Epstein Nord </b>is professor of English and director of the Program in the Study of Women and Gender at Princeton University.<br></p><h2>Journey Into the Past (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>A deep study of the uneasy heart by one of the masters of the psychological novel, <i>Journey into the Past</i>, published here for the first time in America, is a novella that was found among Zweig&#x2019;s papers after his death. Investigating the strange ways in which love, in spite of everything&#x2014;time, war, betrayal&#x2014;can last, Zweig tells the story of Ludwig, an ambitious young man from a modest background who falls in love with the wife of his rich employer. His love is returned, and the couple vow to live together, but then Ludwig is dispatched on business to Mexico, and while he is there the First World War breaks out.

During the 1930s, he was one of the best-selling writers in Europe, and was among the most translated German-language writers before the Second World War. With the rise of Nazism, he moved from Salzburg to London (taking British citizenship), to New York, and finally to Brazil, where he committed suicide with his wife.

Rich in allegorical detail and symbolic imagery, Hawthorne's darkly romantic tales are characterized by the struggle for freedom from social conventions.<br>This original selection of Hawthorne's short fiction features "The Wives of the Dead," concerning widows' reactions to their losses; "The Gray Champion," a tale of the supernatural; and "Wakefield," in which a runaway husband can't quite let go. Other stories include "The Ambitious Guest," "The Minister's Black Veil," "The May-Pole of Merry Mount," "The Great Carbuncle," "Lady Eleanore's Mantle," "The Celestial Rail-road," "The Seven Vagabonds," and "David Swan." The collection concludes with the haunting fable "Fragments from the Journal of a Solitary Man."<br></p><p>Born on the fourth of July in 1804, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote the stories that lie at the heart of the American Romantic movement.

It also contains much practical advice about the acquisition and use of spectra. Starting from the simple 'one pulse' sequence, the text employs a 'building block' approach to lead naturally to multiple pulse and two-dimensional NMR. Spectra of readily available compounds illustrate each technique. One- and two-dimensional methods are integrated in three chapters which show how to solve problems by making connections between spins through bonds, through space, or through exchange. There are also chapters on spectrum editing and solids. The final chapter contains a case history which attempts to weave the many strands of the text into a coherent strategy. This second edition reflects the progress made by NMR in the past few years: there is greater emphasis on inorganic nuclei; some two-color spectra are used; the treatment of heteronuclear experiments has moved from direct to 'inverse' detection; many new examples and spectra have been included; and the literature to early 1992 has been covered. Like the first edition, this work will be highly useful for all NMR spectroscopists: chemists, academic and industrial researchers, and advanced undergraduate and graduate students needing a clear guide to this valuable technology.<br></p><p>Nuclear Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the most powerful research tool used in chemistry today, but many chemists have yet to realize its true potential.

Fix creeks. Eat meat from pasture-raised animals.</p> <p>Scientists maintain that a mere 2 percent increase in the carbon content of the planet&#x2019;s soils could offset <em>100 percent</em> of all greenhouse gas emissions going into the atmosphere. But how could this be accomplished? What would it cost? Is it even possible?&nbsp;</p> <p>Yes, says author Courtney White, it is not only possible, but <em>essential</em> for the long-term health and sustainability of our environment and our economy.</p> <p>Right now, the only possibility of large-scale removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is through plant photosynthesis and related land-based carbon sequestration activities. These include a range of already existing, low-tech, and proven practices: composting, no-till farming, climate-friendly livestock practices, conserving natural habitat, restoring degraded watersheds and rangelands, increasing biodiversity, and producing local food.</p> <p>In <em>Grass, Soil, Hope</em>, the author shows how all these practical strategies can be bundled together into an economic and ecological whole, with the aim of reducing atmospheric CO2 while producing substantial co-benefits for all living things. Soil is a huge natural sink for carbon dioxide. If we can draw increasing amounts carbon out of the atmosphere and store it safely in the soil then we can significantly address all the multiple challenges that now appear so intractable.</p></p><p><p><strong>Courtney White</strong> is the author of <em>Grass, Soil, Hope</em> and <em>Two</em> <em>Percent Solutions for the Planet</em>. A former archaeologist and Sierra Club activist, White dropped out of the &#x201c;conflict industry&#x201d; in 1997 to cofound the Quivira Coalition, a nonprofit dedicated to building bridges between ranchers, conservationists, and others around practices that improve economic and ecological resilience in western working landscapes. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his family.</p><p><em><strong>Foreword Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>&#x201c;Optimism about scientific observations and what people can do to improve the environment makes this book inspiring. In <em>Grass, Soil, Hope: A Journey through Carbon Country</em>, Courtney White provides a compelling and practical account of how carbon&#x2015;an essential element and building block of life&#x2015;may hold the answer to many pressing issues. Smart land use that captures carbon in the soil can enhance the climate, plant and animal diversity, our waterways, the quality of our food, and our quality of life in general. An engaging storyteller, White describes farmers, ranchers, scientists, artists, and many &#x201c;everyday&#x201d; people who are putting these ideas into action.&nbsp; White has crafted a challenging, engaging narrative that will compel many readers to reconsider the link between our soil and the future of our planet.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-<br> <br> </strong></em>White (<em>Revolution on the Range: The Rise of a New Ranch in the American West</em>, 2008 etc.) shows how taking measures to increase the carbon content of the soil can help mitigate global warming. 'Around 30 to 40 percent of the carbon created by photosynthesis can be exuded directly into soil via plant roots to nurture the microbes that help plants grow and build healthy soil,&#x201d; writes the author. The author traveled to speak with soil scientists and visited ranches in the American Southwest and Australia to witness how modern, high-tech ranches were using satellite monitoring and on-the-ground scrutiny to check the condition of the land. He discovered massive ranches that were divided into continually monitored small plots, where farmers tested the soil and ground cover condition and moisture in order to determine where and when to rotate cattle, which were contained by solar-powered, mobile fencing. White also spoke with scientists at the University of California whose experimental data buttressed his hypotheses about carbon soil capture. The author reports efforts to restore wetlands that &#x201c;can sequester carbon at rates up to fifty times those of tropical forests.' White concludes that some sort of incentive-based carbon offset market is required to encourage high-tech investment in soil management. An inspiring can-do approach to the threat of global warming.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><strong><em>Choice-</em> </strong></p> <p>&#x201c;When one thinks of climate change, soil generally is not the first thing that comes to mind. White (Revolution on the Range, 2008), however, takes readers on a journey demonstrating the carbon sequestration power of dirt. He visited ranchers, farmers, urban agriculturists, restoration ecologists, and scientists across the US and in Australia and outlines approaches that not only decrease carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere but also improve ecosystem and human health. Though the case studies clearly show the myriad benefits of these techniques, which include no-till agriculture, pasture cropping, planned grazing systems, and wetland restoration, White also acknowledges challenges that might arise in implementing them. Other books extolling the importance of soil have come out recently and cover much of the same ground. White's background as the cofounder of the Quivira Coalition, a nonprofit that brings together ranchers, environmentalists, and scientists to work to improve land health and build resilience, gives him an inside perspective on the issues he presents and makes the book more accessible to ranchers. Although he sometimes strays off on unrelated tangents, overall, this is an engaging and hopeful read of how humans can work with nature for a brighter future. Summing Up: Recommended. Students of all levels, general readers, and professionals/practitioners.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;A great practical book that I hope will be read by many people in all walks of life, even those who still doubt human-induced climate change. No technology even imaginable can restore nature&#x2019;s past healthy functioning over the Earth&#x2019;s greatest land areas--its vast grasslands.

In our reliance upon the Bible as our source of counsel, many of us overlook what the Scriptures themselves say about the importance of godly friends as a source of wisdom and practical direction for living. Eugene Peterson believes that counsel between companions engaged in a common task--that of following Christ--needs to be revived among believers. In The Wisdom of Each Other, Peterson portrays a relationship between a long-time believer and a seeker wanting to renew his commitment to Christ as they discuss the importance of living out their faith. Drawing from his own experience, Peterson helps us see how God can speak through wise, faith-filled companions, offering guidance, encouragement, and counsel for the challenges and concerns of everyday living.Eugene H.

Whistle-blowers are hunting for her on behalf of Crevan, the Guild's head judge, who is desperate to find her. He believes Celestine has damning incriminating video footage of him abusing his power. After she miraculously escapes nearly being burned alive in Granddad's outdoor cooking pit, Celestine is discovered by Carrick, the fellow Flawed prisoner Celestine first saw in jail. They take refuge in a safe haven where other Flawed and non-Flawed work and live. But is it a refuge if there's an informant in their midst? Other than Carrick, all the witnesses who know the truth about what is on the video, or what it reveals about Celestine, have disappeared. The teen has powerful allies willing to help her defeat Crevan, including an ambitious female Guild judge, a lawyer who succeeded in overturning a Flawed verdict, and the leader of a burgeoning political party that opposes the Guild. The only way Celestine can defeat Crevan is to do the unexpected and challenge him on his own turf, but that proves a very dangerous endeavor. Fans of Flawed will enjoy this intriguing story, with its intelligent and gutsy protagonist and its many double crosses and untrustworthy characters, even if a few are a bit over-the-top.
